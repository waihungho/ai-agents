Outline and Function Summary:

**Agent Name:** "Cognito" - The Cognitive Assistant

**Core Concept:** Cognito is a personalized AI agent designed to augment human intellect and creativity. It focuses on advanced knowledge processing, creative content generation, proactive assistance, and personalized learning. It operates through a Message Command Protocol (MCP) interface, allowing users to interact with it via text-based commands.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

1. **Smart Document Summarization (summarize_doc):**  Analyzes documents and generates concise, informative summaries, extracting key insights and arguments. Handles various document formats (text, PDF, etc.).
2. **Contextual Knowledge Retrieval (know_query):**  Answers user queries based on a vast internal knowledge base, considering the current context of conversation or task. Goes beyond simple keyword search.
3. **Creative Content Generation (generate_creative):**  Produces creative text formats like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc., based on user prompts and style preferences.
4. **Personalized Learning Path Creation (learn_path):**  Designs customized learning paths for users based on their interests, skill gaps, and career goals, recommending relevant resources and courses.
5. **Skill Gap Analysis (skill_gap):**  Identifies discrepancies between a user's current skills and desired skills for a specific job or field, suggesting areas for improvement.
6. **Concept Explanation (explain_concept):**  Provides clear and concise explanations of complex concepts and topics, tailored to the user's level of understanding. Can use analogies and examples.
7. **Trend Identification and Analysis (trend_analyze):**  Analyzes data and information to identify emerging trends in various fields, providing insights and potential implications.
8. **Proactive Task Suggestion (suggest_task):**  Learns user workflows and proactively suggests tasks based on context, time of day, and upcoming deadlines.
9. **Automated Meeting Summarization (meeting_summary):**  Listens to or analyzes meeting transcripts and generates concise summaries of key decisions, action items, and discussions.
10. **Context-Aware Reminder System (smart_reminder):** Sets reminders that are context-aware, meaning they trigger based on location, activity, or specific events, not just time.
11. **Ethical Bias Detection in Text (bias_detect):**  Analyzes text for potential ethical biases related to gender, race, religion, etc., promoting fairness and inclusivity.
12. **Sentiment Analysis and Emotional Tone Detection (sentiment_analyze):**  Analyzes text to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and emotional tone, useful for communication analysis.
13. **Communication Style Adaptation (style_adapt):**  Adapts its communication style based on the user's preferences and the context, making interactions more natural and effective.
14. **Predictive Task Prioritization (task_prioritize):**  Prioritizes tasks based on urgency, importance, and user's historical task completion patterns.
15. **Personalized News and Information Filtering (news_filter):**  Filters news and information based on user's interests and preferences, preventing information overload and focusing on relevant content.
16. **Behavioral Pattern Analysis (behavior_pattern):**  Analyzes user's behavior patterns (e.g., work habits, learning styles) to provide personalized insights and recommendations for improvement.
17. **Adaptive Interface Customization (interface_adapt):**  Dynamically adjusts the user interface based on user behavior and preferences, optimizing for usability and efficiency.
18. **Causal Inference Analysis (causal_infer):**  Attempts to identify causal relationships between events and factors from data, going beyond simple correlation analysis.
19. **Multimodal Input Processing (multimodal_input):**  Accepts and processes input from multiple modalities like text, voice, and potentially images in the future, for richer interaction.
20. **Focus Enhancement and Distraction Management (focus_enhance):**  Provides techniques and tools to help users improve focus and manage distractions, enhancing productivity and concentration.
21. **Stress Detection and Well-being Prompts (stress_detect):**  (Potentially uses sensors in the future, or analyzes communication patterns) to detect stress levels and provides prompts for well-being activities (mindfulness, breaks).
22. **Code Generation and Explanation (code_gen_explain):** Generates code snippets in various programming languages based on user descriptions, and can explain existing code snippets.


**MCP Interface (Message Command Protocol):**

Users interact with Cognito by sending text-based commands. Commands are structured as:

`command_name <argument1> <argument2> ...`

Cognito responds with text-based outputs or actions based on the command.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:** The code starts with a detailed comment block outlining the agent's name ("Cognito"), core concept, and a summary of all 20+ functions. This serves as documentation and a high-level overview.

2.  **`AIAgent` Struct:**  A simple `AIAgent` struct is defined. In a real-world application, this struct would hold the AI models, knowledge bases, configuration, and other necessary components. For this example, it's kept minimal.

3.  **`NewAIAgent` Constructor:** A constructor function `NewAIAgent` is provided to create instances of the `AIAgent`.

4.  **Function Implementations (Methods):**
    *   Each function listed in the summary is implemented as a method on the `AIAgent` struct (e.g., `SummarizeDocument`, `ContextualKnowledgeQuery`, etc.).
    *   **Crucially, these implementations are placeholders.** They use `fmt.Printf` to indicate what function is being called and `time.Sleep` to simulate processing time. In a real AI agent, these functions would contain the actual AI logic (NLP, machine learning models, knowledge graph interactions, etc.).
    *   The function signatures are designed to accept relevant arguments based on the function's purpose (e.g., `docPath` for `SummarizeDocument`, `query` for `ContextualKnowledgeQuery`).
    *   Each function returns a string, which represents the agent's response to the command. Again, in a real system, these responses could be more structured data.

5.  **`HandleCommand` Function:**
    *   This is the core of the MCP interface. It takes a raw command string as input.
    *   It uses `strings.Fields` to parse the command into command name and arguments.
    *   A `switch` statement is used to route the command to the appropriate agent function based on the `commandName`.
    *   Error handling is included for incorrect command usage (e.g., wrong number of arguments).
    *   If the command is unknown, it returns an "Unknown command" message.
    *   It calls the relevant agent function and returns the response.

6.  **`Help` Function:** Provides a `help` command that lists all available commands and their usage. This is essential for a command-line interface.

7.  **`main` Function:**
    *   Creates an instance of the `AIAgent`.
    *   Prints a welcome message and instructions to type `help`.
    *   Enters a loop that:
        *   Prompts the user for input (`> `).
        *   Reads a line of input from the user using `bufio.NewReader`.
        *   Trims whitespace from the input.
        *   If the input is "exit" (case-insensitive), the loop breaks, and the program exits.
        *   Calls `agent.HandleCommand` to process the command and get a response.
        *   Prints the response to the console.

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the code as a `.go` file (e.g., `cognito_agent.go`).
2.  Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3.  Run the command `go run cognito_agent.go`.
4.  You can then interact with the agent by typing commands at the `>` prompt, like `help`, `know_query What is the capital of France?`, `summarize_doc my_document.txt` (though `summarize_doc` won't actually process a file in this example, it will just simulate the action).

**Key Improvements and Real-World Considerations (Beyond this Example):**

*   **Actual AI Logic:**  Replace the placeholder implementations in the agent functions with real AI algorithms, models, and knowledge bases. This would involve using NLP libraries, machine learning frameworks, and data storage solutions.
*   **Data Persistence:** Implement data storage to persist user preferences, learned information, and knowledge.
*   **Error Handling and Robustness:**  Add more comprehensive error handling and input validation.
*   **Concurrency and Asynchronous Operations:** For more complex AI tasks, use Go's concurrency features (goroutines, channels) to handle tasks asynchronously and improve responsiveness.
*   **Modularity and Extensibility:** Design the agent in a modular way so that new functions and capabilities can be easily added.
*   **Security:** If the agent interacts with external services or handles sensitive data, implement appropriate security measures.
*   **User Interface (Beyond MCP):**  While MCP is requested, in a real application, you might also want to provide a more user-friendly GUI or web interface in addition to or instead of a command-line interface.

This example provides a solid foundation and structure for building a more sophisticated AI agent in Go with an MCP interface. The next steps would be to replace the placeholder function implementations with actual AI capabilities relevant to the desired functions.
