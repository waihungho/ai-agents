The following AI Agent, named **AuraPrime**, is designed with a **Meta-Cognitive Protocol (MCP) Interface** to enable advanced self-awareness, introspection, and adaptive capabilities. The MCP allows AuraPrime to manage its own cognitive processes, allocate resources, learn from its performance, and align its actions with high-level goals and ethical principles. The functions proposed are advanced, creative, and tackle trending areas in AI research and application, aiming to avoid direct duplication of existing open-source projects by focusing on the agent's unique self-managing and integrated approach.
