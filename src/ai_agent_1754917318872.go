Okay, this is an exciting challenge! We'll create an AI Agent for Minecraft (simulated) that goes beyond simple botting, focusing on advanced concepts like neuro-symbolic AI, ecological simulation, semantic world understanding, and personalized interactive narrative.

The "MCP interface" will be abstractly represented as a way to send/receive packets and interact with the game world, but the core focus will be on the AI's higher-level cognitive functions. We'll use Golang for its concurrency and strong typing.

## AI Agent: "Aether Weaver"

**Concept:** Aether Weaver is a sophisticated, self-improving AI agent designed to not just interact with a Minecraft-like world but to deeply understand, adapt, and even subtly influence its environment and co-inhabitants (players). It employs a hybrid AI approach, combining symbolic knowledge representation (world ontology) with neural network-like pattern recognition (sentiment analysis, threat prediction). Its core purpose is to create a dynamic, living world experience, optimizing for user engagement, ecological balance, and long-term sustainability.
