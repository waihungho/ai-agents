Okay, here is a Golang implementation of an AI Agent with an "MCP interface" (represented by the `AIAgent` struct and its methods), featuring over 20 distinct, advanced, creative, and trendy functions designed to be conceptually unique.

**Outline:**

1.  **Package and Imports:** Standard Go package and necessary libraries.
2.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `AgentConfig`: Configuration settings for the agent.
    *   `AgentMemory`: Represents the agent's state, context, and knowledge.
    *   `AgentExperience`: Structure to log interactions for learning/reflection.
    *   `AIAgent`: The core struct acting as the "MCP", holding config, memory, and providing methods.
3.  **Constructor:**
    *   `NewAIAgent`: Function to create and initialize a new agent instance.
4.  **Core Agent Methods (The MCP Interface & Functions):**
    *   A collection of 20+ methods on the `AIAgent` struct, each representing a unique function.
    *   Each function takes relevant input and returns a result (often a string or structured data representation) and an error.
    *   Implementations are *simulated* as this is a conceptual example without a full AI backend. They demonstrate the *intent* and *type* of operation.
5.  **Utility/Helper Methods:** (Implicit within function implementations or separate if needed).
6.  **Main Function:** Example usage demonstrating initialization and calling a few functions.
