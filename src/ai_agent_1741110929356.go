# AI Agent in Golang - "CognitoWeave"

**Outline and Function Summary:**

This AI Agent, named "CognitoWeave," is designed as a cognitive enhancer and creative partner, focusing on advanced concepts beyond typical open-source AI functionalities. It aims to assist users in thinking, learning, creating, and problem-solving in novel ways.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

1.  **Dynamic Knowledge Graph Weaving:**  Constructs and maintains a personalized, evolving knowledge graph from user interactions and external data, enabling contextual understanding and knowledge retrieval.
2.  **Metacognitive Self-Assessment:**  Analyzes user's thinking patterns, identifies cognitive biases, and provides feedback to improve metacognition and decision-making.
3.  **Creative Analogy Generation:**  Generates novel and insightful analogies between disparate concepts to foster creative problem-solving and understanding.
4.  **Contextual Learning Path Adaptation:**  Dynamically adjusts learning paths based on user's real-time comprehension, learning style, and knowledge gaps, optimizing learning efficiency.
5.  **Adversarial Idea Refinement:**  Actively challenges user's ideas and assumptions with counter-arguments and alternative perspectives to strengthen critical thinking and idea robustness.
6.  **Predictive Insight Generation (Weak Signal Detection):**  Identifies subtle patterns and weak signals in data to predict emerging trends or potential opportunities/risks before they become obvious.
7.  **Emotional Resonance Analysis:**  Analyzes text and speech to detect and interpret subtle emotional nuances, going beyond basic sentiment analysis to understand emotional depth and resonance.
8.  **Cognitive Load Management:**  Monitors user's cognitive load during tasks and dynamically adjusts information presentation, complexity, and task segmentation to prevent cognitive overload.
9.  **Moral & Ethical Dilemma Simulation:**  Presents complex moral and ethical dilemmas related to user's domain and simulates potential outcomes of different decisions, fostering ethical reasoning.
10. **Interdisciplinary Concept Bridging:**  Identifies connections and analogies between concepts from different disciplines (e.g., physics and sociology) to spark innovative thinking and cross-domain understanding.
11. **Personalized Knowledge Summarization (Adaptive Granularity):**  Summarizes information at varying levels of detail based on user's current context, knowledge level, and information needs.
12. **Counterfactual Scenario Exploration:**  Explores "what-if" scenarios by simulating alternative realities based on changes to key parameters, aiding in risk assessment and strategic planning.
13. **Attention Span Optimization (Focus Anchoring):**  Employs techniques to anchor user's attention and minimize distractions during focused tasks, improving concentration and productivity.
14. **Knowledge Gap Identification & Targeted Questioning:**  Proactively identifies gaps in user's knowledge based on their interactions and asks targeted questions to stimulate deeper learning and exploration.
15. **Cognitive Bias Mitigation Strategies (Real-time Prompts):**  Detects potential cognitive biases during user's reasoning process and provides real-time prompts and strategies to mitigate their influence.
16. **Personalized Communication Style Modulation:**  Adapts its communication style (tone, vocabulary, complexity) to match user's preferences and communication context, enhancing rapport and understanding.
17. **Creative Narrative Generation (Constraint-Based Storytelling):**  Generates creative narratives and stories based on user-defined constraints (themes, characters, plot points), fostering imaginative thinking.
18. **Argumentation Synthesis & Refinement:**  Analyzes arguments presented by the user, identifies weaknesses, and synthesizes stronger, more logically sound arguments.
19. **Hierarchical Task Decomposition & Planning (Dynamic Sub-goaling):**  Breaks down complex tasks into hierarchical sub-tasks and dynamically adjusts the plan based on progress and unexpected events.
20. **Explainable AI Reasoning Traceability (Cognitive Pathway Visualization):**  Provides visualizations and explanations of its reasoning process, making its decision-making transparent and understandable to the user.
21. **Emerging Trend Forecasting with Confidence Intervals:**  Not only predicts trends but also provides confidence intervals for these predictions, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in forecasting.
22. **Personalized Learning Style Profiling (Dynamic Assessment):**  Continuously assesses user's learning style through interaction analysis and dynamically adjusts learning strategies without explicit quizzes.
