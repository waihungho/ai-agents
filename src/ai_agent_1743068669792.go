# AI Agent with MCP Interface in Go

**Outline:**

This Go program defines an AI Agent with a Message Channel Protocol (MCP) interface.
The agent is designed to be modular and extensible, with a focus on advanced and creative functionalities.
It communicates via message passing, allowing for asynchronous and decoupled interactions.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

1.  **PersonalizedNewsDigest:**  Generates a news summary tailored to the user's interests and preferences, learned over time.
2.  **CreativeContentGeneration:**  Produces creative content like poems, stories, scripts, or musical pieces based on user prompts and styles.
3.  **HypothesisGeneration:**  Formulates novel hypotheses and research questions based on provided datasets or information gaps.
4.  **ComplexTaskOrchestration:**  Breaks down complex user tasks into smaller sub-tasks and orchestrates their execution by internal or external modules.
5.  **AdaptiveLearningSystem:**  Continuously learns from user interactions and feedback to improve its performance and personalize its responses.
6.  **EmotionallyIntelligentResponse:**  Detects and responds to user emotions conveyed in text or voice, aiming for empathetic and contextually appropriate interactions.
7.  **PredictiveMaintenanceAnalysis:**  Analyzes sensor data and historical records to predict potential equipment failures and recommend maintenance schedules.
8.  **EthicalDilemmaSimulation:**  Presents users with ethical dilemmas and simulates the consequences of different choices, fostering ethical reasoning.
9.  **PersonalizedWellnessRecommendations:**  Provides tailored wellness advice (diet, exercise, mindfulness) based on user data and health goals.
10. **AugmentedRealityAssistance:**  Provides real-time contextual information and guidance overlaid onto the user's view through AR interfaces (simulated here).
11. **SkillGapAnalysisAndTraining:**  Analyzes user skills, identifies gaps based on desired roles, and recommends personalized learning paths.
12. **DecentralizedDataAnalytics:**  Performs data analysis on data distributed across multiple sources, leveraging federated learning or similar techniques (simulated).
13. **CausalInferenceEngine:**  Attempts to infer causal relationships from data, going beyond correlation to understand underlying causes.
14. **ExplainableAIOutput:**  Provides explanations for its decisions and predictions, enhancing transparency and user trust.
15. **DreamInterpretationAssistant:**  Analyzes user-recorded dreams and offers potential interpretations based on symbolic and psychological models (creative and speculative).
16. **CollaborativeDecisionMakingSupport:**  Facilitates group decision-making by analyzing arguments, identifying consensus, and suggesting compromises.
17. **PersonalizedEducationTutoring:**  Provides individualized tutoring and learning experiences, adapting to the student's pace and learning style.
18. **IoTDeviceManagementAndAutomation:**  Manages and automates interactions with connected IoT devices, based on user-defined rules and AI-driven optimizations.
19. **FederatedLearningParticipant:**  Participates in federated learning frameworks to collaboratively train models without centralizing data.
20. **CybersecurityThreatIntelligence:**  Analyzes network traffic and security logs to identify potential cybersecurity threats and recommend mitigation strategies.
21. **ScientificLiteratureReviewAssistant:**  Helps researchers review scientific literature by summarizing papers, identifying key findings, and finding relevant connections.
22. **PersonalizedFinancialPlanningAdvisor:**  Provides tailored financial advice based on user's financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.


**MCP Interface:**

The agent uses channels for message passing.
- `RequestChannel`:  Receives `Message` structs representing requests for agent functions.
- `ResponseChannel`: Sends `Message` structs containing responses from the agent.

Messages are structured as follows:
```go
type Message struct {
	MessageType string      `json:"message_type"` // Function name or message identifier
	Payload     interface{} `json:"payload"`      // Data associated with the message
}
```

**Example Usage (in `main` function):**

1. Create an `AIAgent` instance.
2. Run the agent in a goroutine (`go agent.Run()`).
3. Send messages to `agent.RequestChannel` with `MessageType` corresponding to function names and relevant `Payload`.
4. Receive responses from `agent.ResponseChannel`.
