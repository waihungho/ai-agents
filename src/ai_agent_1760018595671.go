This AI Agent architecture, named "Aetheria," features a Master-Control Program (MCP) interface designed to orchestrate a suite of advanced, self-evolving, and context-aware AI functionalities. Aetheria aims to go beyond conventional AI applications by integrating capabilities that foster true adaptability, ethical reasoning, and proactive problem-solving.

### Aetheria: AI Agent with MCP Interface

**Project Outline:**

*   **`main.go`**: The entry point, responsible for initializing the MCP, registering all AI modules, starting their operational goroutines, and demonstrating command issuance and event subscription.
*   **`mcp/mcp.go`**: Implements the Master-Control Program (MCP). It acts as the central nervous system, managing command dispatch to modules, routing events from modules, maintaining overall agent and module states, and facilitating inter-module communication.
*   **`types/types.go`**: Defines all shared data structures, including `Command`, `Event`, `AgentState`, `ModuleState`, and various command/event specific payloads.
*   **`modules/module.go`**: Provides a base `AgentModule` interface and a `BaseModule` struct to encapsulate common functionalities like logging, state management, and command/event handling for all specialized AI modules.
*   **`modules/*.go`**: Contains the implementations for each of the 22 unique AI agent functions. Each file defines a specific module adhering to the `AgentModule` interface, implementing its specialized logic.
