Okay, this is a fantastic challenge! We'll design an AI Agent for Minecraft with an MCP (Minecraft Protocol) interface in Golang. The focus will be on highly conceptual, advanced, and creative functions that go beyond typical bot behaviors.

To ensure no duplication of existing open-source projects, we'll avoid common bot features like simple pathfinding, basic farming, or direct block placement from a predefined plan. Instead, we'll focus on:

1.  **High-Level Cognition:** Interpreting the world semantically, predicting, learning, and self-optimizing.
2.  **Generative AI:** Creating novel structures, patterns, or behaviors.
3.  **Cross-Modal Integration:** Potentially connecting to external AI models (conceptually).
4.  **Socio-Emotional Interaction:** Understanding and influencing player behavior.
5.  **Ecological and Strategic Management:** Operating at a systems level within the game.

## AI Agent Outline & Function Summary

This AI Agent, named "Aether Weaver," operates within the Minecraft environment via a conceptual MCP (Minecraft Protocol) interface. It aims to transcend basic automation, exhibiting sophisticated cognitive, creative, and adaptive behaviors.

**Core Modules:**
*   **Perception & World Modeling:** Builds and maintains a rich, semantic understanding of its environment.
*   **Cognition & Reasoning:** Processes sensory data, makes decisions, learns, and plans.
*   **Generative Systems:** Creates novel outputs (structures, patterns, melodies).
*   **Interaction & Communication:** Engages with players and the environment intelligently.
*   **Self-Management & Optimization:** Monitors its own performance and adapts its strategies.
