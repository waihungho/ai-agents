Okay, here is a design and implementation outline for an AI Agent in Go with an `MCPInterface` (Modular Capability Platform Interface), featuring over 20 unique, advanced, creative, and trendy functions.

This agent will simulate advanced AI capabilities using Go's core features (string manipulation, simple data structures, control flow) rather than integrating with actual large language models or complex AI libraries. This fulfills the "don't duplicate any of open source" requirement by providing novel conceptual functions and their *simulated* implementation logic.

---

```go
// Package main implements an example of an AI agent with a Modular Capability Platform (MCP) interface.
// It provides a set of advanced, creative, and trendy AI-like functions simulated in Go.
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"strings"
	"time"
)
