# AI-Agent with MCP Interface in Golang

## Outline and Function Summary:

This AI-Agent, named "CognitoAgent," is designed with a Message Channel Protocol (MCP) interface for communication. It aims to be a versatile and creative agent capable of performing a range of advanced and trendy functions.  It utilizes Go channels for message passing, enabling asynchronous communication.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

1.  **SummarizeText:**  Analyzes and summarizes long text into concise points.
2.  **CreativeStoryGenerator:** Generates imaginative and unique short stories based on keywords or themes.
3.  **PersonalizedNewsBriefing:**  Curates a news briefing based on user-defined interests and preferences.
4.  **TrendForecasting:**  Analyzes data to predict emerging trends in various domains (e.g., technology, fashion).
5.  **SentimentAnalyzer:**  Determines the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) of text or social media posts.
6.  **SmartTaskScheduler:**  Optimizes task scheduling based on deadlines, priorities, and user availability.
7.  **ProactiveReminder:**  Sets reminders based on context and user behavior, not just explicit requests.
8.  **CreativeRecipeGenerator:**  Generates novel and interesting recipes based on available ingredients and dietary preferences.
9.  **PersonalizedWorkoutPlan:**  Creates customized workout plans based on fitness goals, available equipment, and user profile.
10. **LanguageStyleTransformer:**  Rewrites text in different styles (e.g., formal, informal, poetic, humorous).
11. **CodeSnippetGenerator:**  Generates short code snippets in various programming languages based on description.
12. **HypotheticalScenarioSimulator:**  Simulates potential outcomes of hypothetical scenarios and decisions.
13. **PersonalizedLearningPath:**  Creates customized learning paths for users based on their goals and current knowledge.
14. **AbstractArtGenerator:**  Generates unique abstract art pieces based on user-defined parameters (colors, shapes, moods).
15. **MusicMoodClassifier:**  Analyzes music and classifies it based on perceived mood or genre.
16. **DreamInterpreter:**  Provides symbolic interpretations of user-described dreams (for entertainment/creative inspiration).
17. **CognitiveGameGenerator:**  Creates simple cognitive games tailored to user's cognitive skill focus.
18. **EthicalDilemmaGenerator:**  Presents users with thought-provoking ethical dilemmas to stimulate critical thinking.
19. **PersonalizedQuoteGenerator:**  Generates inspirational or relevant quotes tailored to the user's current context or mood.
20. **KnowledgeGraphQuery:**  Queries and retrieves information from an internal knowledge graph based on user questions.
21. **BiasDetectionInText:** Analyzes text for potential biases (gender, racial, etc.) and flags them.
22. **CreativeNameGenerator:** Generates creative and unique names for projects, products, or characters.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:** The code starts with a detailed outline and summary of all 22 functions, as requested, providing a clear overview of the agent's capabilities.

2.  **MCP Interface:**
    *   **`Message` struct:** Defines the structure of messages sent to the agent. It includes `Action` (the function to call), `Payload` (data for the function), and `ResponseChan` (a channel for the agent to send the response back).
    *   **`Response` struct:** Defines the structure of responses sent back by the agent, including `Status`, `Data`, and `Error` (if any).
    *   **`AIAgent` struct:** Represents the AI agent itself. It has a `messageChannel` (a Go channel for receiving messages) and a simple `knowledgeGraph` (for demonstration of `KnowledgeGraphQuery`).
    *   **`Run()` method:** This is the core loop of the agent. It continuously listens for messages on the `messageChannel`, processes them using `processMessage()`, and sends the response back through the `ResponseChan`.
    *   **`SendMessage()` method:** A helper function to send a message to the agent and wait for the response, simplifying interaction from the `main` function.

3.  **Function Implementations (22 Functions):**
    *   Each function is implemented as a method on the `AIAgent` struct.
    *   **Simulated Logic:** For simplicity and to focus on the interface and function variety, many functions use simulated or placeholder logic. In a real-world AI agent, these functions would be replaced with actual AI algorithms, models, or API calls.
    *   **Variety and Creativity:** The functions cover a wide range of trendy and creative areas, as requested, from text summarization and creative writing to personalized recommendations, trend forecasting, and even dream interpretation and abstract art generation.
    *   **No Open-Source Duplication (Intentional):** The functions are designed to be conceptually unique and not directly replicate specific open-source projects, although they might touch upon similar themes or areas.

4.  **Helper Functions:**
    *   `successResponse()` and `errorResponse()`:  Simplify the creation of `Response` structs with consistent status and error handling.

5.  **`main()` Function (Example Usage):**
    *   Sets up random seed for varied outputs.
    *   Creates an `AIAgent` instance.
    *   Starts the agent's `Run()` loop in a goroutine (allowing it to run concurrently and listen for messages).
    *   Demonstrates sending messages to the agent for each of the 22 functions and printing the responses.
    *   Includes a `time.Sleep(time.Minute)` at the end to keep the `main` function running for demonstration purposes, allowing you to see the agent's output in the console before the program exits.

**To Run the Code:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.go` file (e.g., `cognito_agent.go`).
2.  **Compile and Run:** Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run:
    ```bash
    go run cognito_agent.go
    ```

You will see the output of the example interactions in the console, demonstrating how to send messages to the AI agent and receive responses for each of its functions.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Simulated AI:**  This code is a demonstration of the structure and interface of an AI agent.  The actual "AI" logic within each function is highly simplified and simulated. To make this a real AI agent, you would need to replace the placeholder logic with actual AI models, algorithms, or API integrations.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling is basic in this example. In a production system, you would need more robust error handling and logging.
*   **Scalability and Complexity:** This is a simplified example. For a more complex and scalable AI agent, you would likely need to consider:
    *   Using a more robust message queue or message broker for MCP (instead of just Go channels).
    *   Implementing proper concurrency and parallelism within the agent to handle multiple requests efficiently.
    *   Integrating with external AI services, databases, and knowledge bases.
    *   Designing a more sophisticated architecture for managing different AI models and functions.
*   **Knowledge Graph:** The `knowledgeGraph` in this example is a very simple in-memory map. For a real knowledge graph, you would use a dedicated graph database (like Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, etc.).
