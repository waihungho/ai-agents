AI Agent with MCP Interface in Golang

Outline and Function Summary:

This AI Agent, named "SynergyMind," operates through a Message Channel Protocol (MCP) for communication. It's designed to be a versatile and adaptive agent capable of performing a diverse set of advanced and trendy functions.  The functions are designed to be creative and avoid direct duplication of common open-source AI functionalities.

Function Summary:

1.  **Personalized Ephemeral Story Weaver:** Creates short, personalized stories that vanish after being read, tailored to user mood and current events.
2.  **Dreamscape Navigator:** Analyzes user-provided dream descriptions and generates symbolic interpretations, offering insights and creative prompts.
3.  **Context-Aware Creative Muse:** Provides real-time creative suggestions (writing prompts, musical motifs, design ideas) based on the user's current digital context (open applications, browsing history - ethically and with permission).
4.  **Hyper-Personalized News Curator (Filter Bubble Breaker):**  Aggregates news from diverse sources, actively identifying and presenting counter-narratives and differing perspectives related to user interests, breaking filter bubbles.
5.  **Adaptive Language Style Transformer:**  Rewrites text in various styles (Shakespearean, Hemingway, futuristic slang, etc.) while preserving the core meaning and user's intent.
6.  **Emotional Resonance Music Composer:**  Generates original music tailored to evoke specific emotions based on user input (textual description, mood selection, biofeedback - if available).
7.  **Decentralized Knowledge Synthesizer:**  Aggregates information from distributed sources (web, local files, connected devices) to synthesize novel insights and answer complex, multi-faceted queries.
8.  **Predictive Task Orchestrator:**  Learns user workflows and proactively suggests or automates sequences of tasks based on time, location, and predicted needs.
9.  **Ethical AI Bias Detector & Mitigator (for User Content):**  Analyzes user-generated content (text, images) for potential unconscious biases (gender, racial, etc.) and suggests neutral phrasing or alternative representations.
10. **Interactive Scenario Simulator (Decision Sandbox):**  Allows users to define scenarios with variables and simulate potential outcomes, aiding in decision-making and strategic planning.
11. **Personalized Learning Path Generator (Skills Navigator):**  Creates customized learning paths for users to acquire new skills, adapting to their learning style, pace, and goals, drawing from diverse educational resources.
12. **Dynamic Data Visualization Artist:**  Transforms complex datasets into aesthetically pleasing and insightful visualizations that evolve and adapt in real-time based on data changes.
13. **Cross-Modal Analogy Generator:**  Identifies and generates analogies between seemingly disparate domains (e.g., "The stock market is like a fluctuating ocean current").
14. **Privacy-Preserving Personal Data Anonymizer:**  Intelligently anonymizes user's personal data (text, images, location data) while preserving its utility for specific purposes (e.g., sharing feedback without revealing identity).
15. **Quantum-Inspired Optimization Assistant (Conceptual):**  Explores complex optimization problems using algorithms inspired by quantum computing principles (even on classical hardware) to find near-optimal solutions for tasks like resource allocation or scheduling.
16. **Embodied AI Avatar Customizer (Personality Mirror):**  Creates personalized AI avatars that reflect aspects of the user's personality, communication style, and preferences, for use in virtual environments or as a digital representative.
17. **Generative Art Installation Director:**  Creates instructions and parameters for generative art installations (visual, auditory, interactive) adapting to the environment and audience interaction in real-time.
18. **Personalized Fact-Checking & Source Credibility Assessor:**  Verifies information encountered by the user, providing source credibility scores and identifying potential misinformation patterns tailored to user's information consumption habits.
19. **Ubiquitous Contextual Reminder System (Beyond To-Dos):**  Provides subtle, contextually relevant reminders and prompts not just for tasks, but for intentions, goals, and values, subtly guiding user behavior towards their aspirations.
20. **Collaborative Idea Incubator (Brainstorming Partner):**  Facilitates brainstorming sessions with users, generating novel ideas, challenging assumptions, and providing diverse perspectives to enhance creativity and problem-solving.

**Explanation and Key Concepts:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:**  The code starts with a detailed outline and summary of all 20+ functions, as requested. This provides a clear overview of the agent's capabilities before diving into the code.

2.  **Message Channel Protocol (MCP):**
    *   The agent uses a Go channel (`messageChannel`) as its MCP. This is a simple and effective way for different parts of a Go application (or even external systems if extended) to communicate asynchronously.
    *   The `Message` struct defines the structure of messages sent to the agent, including the `Function` name, `Payload` (data for the function), and `ResponseChan` (a channel for the agent to send back the result).
    *   `SendMessage()` is the function clients use to send requests to the agent. It constructs a `Message` and returns the `ResponseChan` so the client can wait for and receive the agent's response.
    *   The `Start()` method runs a loop that continuously listens on the `messageChannel`. When a message arrives, it's dispatched to `handleMessage()`.
    *   `handleMessage()` uses a `switch` statement to route the message to the appropriate function handler based on the `msg.Function`.

3.  **Agent Structure (`AIAgent` struct):**
    *   The `AIAgent` struct holds the `messageChannel` and an `agentName` for identification.
    *   You can extend this struct to include internal state like user profiles, knowledge bases, models, etc., depending on the complexity of your agent.

4.  **Function Implementations (Placeholders):**
    *   Each function (e.g., `PersonalizedEphemeralStory`, `DreamscapeNavigator`) is implemented as a method on the `AIAgent` struct.
    *   **Crucially, these implementations are placeholders.** They provide basic functionality and print informative messages, but they **do not contain real, sophisticated AI logic.**
    *   **To make this a *real* AI agent, you would replace the placeholder logic within each function with actual AI algorithms, models, and data processing.** This could involve:
        *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text-based functions.
        *   Machine Learning models (e.g., for prediction, classification, generation).
        *   Knowledge graphs or databases for information retrieval and synthesis.
        *   Rule-based systems for certain tasks.
        *   External APIs for data sources or specialized AI services.

5.  **Example `main()` Function:**
    *   The `main()` function demonstrates how to create an `AIAgent`, start it in a goroutine, and send messages to it using `agent.SendMessage()`.
    *   It shows how to receive responses from the agent through the `ResponseChan`.
    *   Example calls are provided for several of the functions to illustrate how to interact with the agent.

**To Turn This into a Functional AI Agent:**

1.  **Replace Placeholder Logic:**  This is the core task. For each function, you need to implement the actual AI logic.  This will likely involve using Go libraries for NLP, machine learning, data analysis, etc., or integrating with external AI services.
2.  **Data Sources and Models:**  Determine the data sources your agent will need (e.g., web APIs, databases, local files). Train or integrate pre-trained AI models for tasks like text generation, classification, analysis, etc.
3.  **Error Handling and Robustness:**  Add proper error handling, input validation, and mechanisms to make the agent more robust and reliable.
4.  **State Management:**  If your agent needs to maintain state across interactions (e.g., user profiles, conversation history), implement appropriate state management mechanisms.
5.  **Scalability (Optional):** If you need to handle many concurrent requests, consider making the agent scalable (e.g., using Go's concurrency features effectively, or designing it for distributed deployment).

This code provides a solid foundation and framework for building a creative and advanced AI agent in Go. The key is to replace the placeholder function logic with your desired AI algorithms and functionalities.
