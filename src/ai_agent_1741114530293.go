15. **Anomaly Detection & Alerting (Personalized):**  Learns user's typical patterns and detects anomalies in behavior, data, or environment, providing timely alerts for potential issues.
16. **Proactive Information Retrieval & Filtering:**  Based on user's current context and goals, proactively retrieves and filters relevant information from various sources, saving user search time.
17. **Skill Gap Analysis & Recommendation:**  Analyzes user's current skills and desired career paths to identify skill gaps and recommend relevant learning resources or training.
18. **Cross-Language Semantic Understanding & Translation (Contextual):**  Goes beyond literal translation to understand the semantic meaning across languages, considering cultural context and nuances.
19. **Personalized News & Trend Aggregation:**  Aggregates news and trend information from diverse sources, filtering and prioritizing content based on user interests and relevance.
20. **Adaptive User Interface Customization (AI-Driven):**  Dynamically adjusts the user interface of applications or systems based on user behavior and preferences, optimizing usability and efficiency.
21. **Automated Report Generation & Data Visualization (Personalized):**  Automatically generates reports and data visualizations tailored to user needs, summarizing key findings and insights from data sources.
22. **Environmental Awareness & Context-Based Recommendations:**  Integrates with environmental sensors (if available) to understand the surrounding environment (weather, location, noise level, etc.) and provide contextually relevant recommendations.


This is a conceptual outline. Actual implementation would require integrating various AI/ML models and techniques.

**Conceptual Explanation and Advanced Concepts:**

**Cognito Weaver's Core Philosophy:**

Cognito Weaver is designed to be more than just a tool; it aims to be a **cognitive partner**. It focuses on:

*   **Deep Contextual Understanding:**  Moving beyond keyword matching to grasp the user's true intent, considering past interactions, user profile, and even emotional state.
*   **Creative Augmentation:**  Not just processing information, but actively generating novel ideas, content, and solutions to assist users in creative endeavors.
*   **Personalization at its Core:**  Tailoring every interaction and output to the individual user, learning their preferences, adapting to their style, and anticipating their needs.
*   **Ethical and Responsible AI:**  Proactively addressing biases and promoting transparency in its decision-making, ensuring fairness and trust.
*   **Proactive Assistance:**  Taking initiative to offer helpful suggestions, information, and actions before being explicitly asked, acting as a true assistant.

**Advanced Concepts Incorporated (or intended for future implementation):**

*   **Knowledge Graph:** A dynamic and personalized knowledge graph is central to the agent's understanding and reasoning capabilities. This allows for semantic search, concept exploration, and richer connections between information.
*   **Causal Inference:**  Moving beyond correlation to understand cause-and-effect relationships is a crucial step towards more intelligent and proactive AI. This allows the agent to anticipate consequences and provide more informed recommendations.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):**  Transparency and trust are paramount. Providing explanations for AI actions makes the agent more understandable and accountable.
*   **Emotional AI:**  Recognizing and responding to user emotions leads to more empathetic and human-like interactions, enhancing user experience and trust.
*   **Generative Models:**  Leveraging generative AI models (for text, images, music, stories) unlocks creative potential and allows the agent to produce novel outputs tailored to user needs.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Continuously learning from user interactions and feedback to improve its performance, personalize its responses, and refine its understanding of the user.
*   **Multimodal Interaction (Future Extension):** While this outline primarily focuses on text, future iterations could incorporate multimodal input (voice, images, sensor data) and output to create a richer and more versatile agent.

**Note:** This Golang code provides an outline and conceptual structure.  To fully realize the functionality described, each `// TODO: Implement ...` section would require substantial development involving integration with various AI/ML libraries, models, APIs, and potentially custom-built algorithms.  This outline serves as a blueprint for a complex and innovative AI agent in Golang.
