2.  **Cross-Modal Content Synthesis (SynesthesiaFusion):** Combines information from different modalities (text, image, audio, video) to create new, synergistic content. For example, generate a song inspired by a painting and its textual description, or create a visual representation of a poem.
3.  **Hyper-Personalized Learning Path Generation (EduSynergy):** Creates adaptive and highly personalized learning paths for users based on their learning style, goals, existing knowledge, and preferred learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).
4.  **Proactive Trend Forecasting & Opportunity Discovery (ForesightEngine):** Analyzes diverse data streams (social media, news, market trends, scientific publications) to proactively identify emerging trends and potential opportunities in various domains (business, technology, social changes).
5.  **Ethical AI Alignment & Bias Mitigation (EthicsGuard):**  Analyzes AI model outputs and processes to identify and mitigate potential ethical biases. Provides recommendations for fairer and more aligned AI outcomes, ensuring responsible AI development and deployment.
6.  **Complex Problem Decomposition & Collaborative Solution Generation (ProblemSolverPro):**  Breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems.  Then, it uses a simulated collaborative approach (or integrates with real-world collaborative tools) to generate diverse solution options and recommendations by leveraging various AI models and knowledge sources.
7.  **Emotional Resonance Analysis & Empathy Mapping (EmpathyLens):**  Analyzes text, audio, and potentially video to understand the underlying emotional tone and user sentiment. Creates empathy maps to visualize user emotions and perspectives, aiding in more human-centered design and communication.
8.  **Quantum-Inspired Optimization for Resource Allocation (QuantumOptimizer):**  Applies quantum-inspired algorithms (like quantum annealing or quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms) to optimize resource allocation in complex systems (e.g., supply chains, energy grids, network traffic).  Aims for near-optimal solutions in computationally challenging scenarios.
9.  **Bio-Inspired Design & Biomimicry Innovation (BioDesignLab):**  Leverages principles of biomimicry to generate innovative design solutions inspired by nature.  Analyzes biological systems and processes to derive novel approaches for engineering, architecture, and product design.
10. **Synthetic Data Generation for Privacy-Preserving AI (PrivacySynth):**  Generates high-quality synthetic data that mimics the statistical properties of real-world data but without revealing sensitive information.  Enables training of AI models on privacy-sensitive data while adhering to data protection regulations.
11. **Explainable AI (XAI) Narrative Generation (ClarityNarrator):**  Provides human-readable explanations for AI model decisions and predictions.

Employs meta-learning techniques to improve its overall intelligence and problem-solving capabilities over time, evolving its core functionalities.


**MCP Interface Definition:**

The agent will communicate via messages. Each message will have a `RequestType` indicating the function to be executed and a `Payload` containing the necessary data for the function.  The agent will respond with a `Response` message, potentially containing the result of the function execution or an error message.

**Explanation and Next Steps:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:** The code starts with a detailed outline and function summary as requested, clearly describing the agent's concept ("SynergyAI"), interface (MCP), and each of the 21 functions (including a bonus function).

2.  **MCP Interface Implementation:**
    *   `RequestType` enum: Defines all possible request types as constants.
    *   `Message` struct: Defines the structure for messages passed to and from the agent. It includes `RequestType`, `Payload`, `Response`, and `Error` fields.
    *   `AgentInterface`: Defines the `SendMessage` and `ReceiveMessage` methods, establishing the MCP contract.
    *   `AIAgent` struct: Represents the AI agent itself. You can add internal state (like loaded AI models, configuration) here as needed.
    *   `NewAIAgent()`: Constructor to create a new `AIAgent` instance.
    *   `SendMessage()`: This is the central function that receives a `Message`, uses a `switch` statement based on `RequestType` to call the appropriate function within the `AIAgent`, and constructs a `Response` message.
    *   `ReceiveMessage()`:  A placeholder function. In a real-world asynchronous MCP system, this would be implemented to listen for and receive messages. In this synchronous example, it returns a default "not implemented" message.

3.  **Function Stubs:**
    *   For each of the 21 functions (PersonalizedStorytelling, CrossModalContentSynthesis, etc.), there is a function stub in the `AIAgent` struct.
    *   Each stub currently:
        *   Prints a message indicating the function was called and its payload.
        *   Includes a `// TODO:` comment indicating where you should implement the actual AI logic.
        *   Simulates processing time with `time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)`.
        *   Returns a placeholder `map[string]interface{}` response indicating the function was called.

4.  **`main()` Function - Example Usage:**
    *   Creates an instance of `AIAgent`.
    *   Demonstrates how to use the `SendMessage` interface with two examples:
        *   `PersonalizedStorytelling`: Sends a request with a payload specifying story preferences and prints the JSON response.
        *   `EthicalAIAlignment`: Sends a request (with a dummy payload) and prints the response.
        *   `Unknown Request`: Shows how the agent handles an invalid `RequestType`.
        *   `ReceiveMessage`: Calls the placeholder `ReceiveMessage` and prints its (placeholder) output.

**To make this a fully functional AI Agent, you need to:**

1.  **Implement the AI Logic in each Function Stub:**
    *   Replace the `// TODO:` comments in each function (e.g., `PersonalizedStorytelling`, `CrossModalContentSynthesis`, etc.) with the actual Go code that performs the AI task described in the function summary.
    *   This will involve:
        *   Choosing appropriate Go libraries or external AI services for each task (e.g., for NLP, image processing, data analysis, etc.).
        *   Loading and using AI models (if required).
        *   Processing the `payload` of the message to get the input data.
        *   Performing the AI task (e.g., generating a story, analyzing data, etc.).
        *   Constructing a meaningful `response` to be sent back to the caller.
    *   Consider error handling within each function and return errors appropriately.

2.  **Define Payloads and Responses:**
    *   For each `RequestType`, you'll need to define the expected structure of the `Payload` and the `Response`.  Use structs or maps to clearly define the data that is being exchanged.
    *   The current `payload` and `response` are using `interface{}` for flexibility in this outline, but in a real application, you should use more specific types for better type safety and clarity.

3.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust error handling throughout the agent.  Return meaningful error messages in the `Error` field of the `Message` struct when something goes wrong in any of the functions.

4.  **Asynchronous Communication (Optional but Recommended for Scalability):**
    *   For a more robust and scalable agent, consider making the MCP interface asynchronous. This could involve using Go channels for message passing, goroutines for concurrent processing of requests, and potentially message queues (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) for more advanced message handling.
    *   You would need to fully implement the `ReceiveMessage` function to handle incoming messages asynchronously.

5.  **Configuration and State Management:**
    *   If your agent needs to load models, API keys, or other configurations, implement a configuration mechanism (e.g., reading from a config file or environment variables).
    *   Manage the agent's internal state appropriately within the `AIAgent` struct.

This outline provides a strong foundation for building a sophisticated and feature-rich AI agent in Go using an MCP interface. The next steps are to flesh out the AI logic within each function and refine the communication and error handling for a production-ready system.
