Okay, let's design an AI Agent in Go with an MCP (Master Control Program) interface structure. The agent will act as the central orchestrator, communicating with various modular components via a defined interface. The advanced functions will be concepts that the agent coordinates or delegates to specific components, rather than being monolithic functions within the agent itself.

We will define the `Component` interface as the MCP interface. The agent will hold and interact with objects implementing this interface.

Here's the outline and function summary, followed by the Go code.

```go
// Package main implements a conceptual AI Agent with an MCP (Master Control Program) interface.
// The agent acts as an orchestrator, communicating with various components via a defined interface.

/*
Outline:

1.  Goal: Create a modular AI Agent architecture in Go using an "MCP" interface pattern.
2.  Architecture:
    *   Central Agent (MCP): Manages state, processes events, and dispatches commands.
    *   Components: Modular units implementing the 'Component' interface, handling specific tasks (sensing, processing, action, memory, etc.).
    *   Communication: Asynchronous message passing via Go channels (AgentCommand, ComponentEvent).
    *   Lifecycle Management: Agent starts and stops components.
3.  MCP Interface: The `Component` interface defines the contract for all agent modules (Start, Stop, ID).
4.  Data Structures:
    *   `AgentCommand`: Data structure for agent -> component messages.
    *   `ComponentEvent`: Data structure for component -> agent messages.
5.  Core Agent Logic:
    *   Registration of components.
    *   Main event loop processing incoming events (from components, potentially external).
    *   Decision-making (simplified placeholder logic).
    *   Dispatching commands to components.
6.  Advanced Functions (Conceptual): A list of 20+ creative/advanced capabilities facilitated by hypothetical components interacting with the agent. These functions are described conceptually as tasks the agent coordinates, rather than specific Go functions within the Agent struct itself.
7.  Example Components: Simple stub implementations of components (e.g., Sensor, Processor, Effector) to demonstrate the communication flow.

Function Summary (20+ Advanced Capabilities):

These functions represent the *types of tasks* the agent can perform by coordinating its components. They are not direct methods on the `Agent` struct but are facilitated by the architecture.

Perception & Input Processing:
1.  **Hyperspectral Data Fusion:** Combine incoming data streams from simulated different spectrum bands (e.g., visual, infrared, novel data types) via Sensor components to form a richer understanding.
2.  **Predictive Anomaly Detection (Sensor):** Identify unusual patterns within fused sensor data that indicate potential future deviations before they occur.
3.  **Contextual Sentiment & Intent Analysis:** Analyze incoming text/voice/communication streams not just for sentiment, but for underlying intent and the specific operational context.
4.  **Subtle Environmental Drift Tracking:** Detect slow, cumulative changes in environmental parameters over extended periods that might signify important shifts (e.g., gradual resource depletion, cultural norm shifts in data).
5.  **Network Influence Mapping & Trend Forecasting:** Analyze external communication network data (simulated) to identify key influencers and predict the spread of ideas or behaviors.
6.  **Adaptive Noise Filtering:** Dynamically adjust sensory input processing based on identified noise patterns and current task priorities.

Cognition & Processing:
7.  **Counterfactual Simulation & Scenario Exploration:** Simulate hypothetical "what-if" scenarios based on current state and potential actions to evaluate outcomes.
8.  **Self-Modifying Goal Optimization & Prioritization:** Dynamically adjust and re-prioritize agent's operational goals based on performance, environmental feedback, and long-term projections.
9.  **Conceptual Blending & Novel Idea Synthesis:** Combine disparate concepts from knowledge base and incoming data to generate novel ideas or solutions.
10. **Causal Relationship Discovery from Events:** Analyze sequences of processed events to identify potential causal links and dependencies.
11. **Episodic Memory Consolidation & Retrieval:** Store and retrieve sequences of events with rich contextual information, supporting narrative recall and pattern recognition over time.
12. **Predictive Resource Allocation (Probabilistic):** Forecast future resource needs (computation, energy, specific data types) based on predicted tasks and probabilities, allocating preemptively.
13. **Dynamic Persona & Communication Style Adaptation:** Automatically adjust the agent's communication style, tone, and vocabulary based on the perceived characteristics of the entity it's interacting with and the interaction goal.
14. **Hierarchical Adaptive Task Decomposition:** Break down complex, high-level goals into executable sub-tasks, dynamically adjusting the plan if sub-tasks fail or encounter unexpected conditions.
15. **Internal Bias Identification & Mitigation:** Analyze its own decision-making processes and historical actions to identify potential biases and suggest/apply mitigation strategies.
16. **Autonomous Knowledge Graph Expansion:** Continuously learn new entities, relationships, and properties from processed data and integrate them into its internal knowledge graph.
17. **Abductive Reasoning for Hypothesis Generation:** Formulate plausible explanations (hypotheses) for observed phenomena based on incomplete information.
18. **Meta-Cognitive State Monitoring:** Monitor its own internal processing states (e.g., confidence levels, processing load, uncertainty) and report/act upon them.

Action & Output Generation:
19. **Procedural Content Generation (Adaptive Output):** Generate complex outputs (e.g., detailed reports, simulated environments, complex instructions) based on internal state and goals, adapting format and content to the recipient and context.
20. **Multi-Modal Output Synthesis & Orchestration:** Combine different output modalities (e.g., generating explanatory text alongside a relevant simulated visualization or alert sound) for richer communication.
21. **Context-Aware Recommendation Engine (Proactive):** Provide unsolicited recommendations for actions, information retrieval, or component activation based on predicted future needs or opportunities.
22. **Negotiation Strategy Formulation & Execution (Simulated/Abstract):** Develop and execute strategies for simulated negotiation scenarios based on game theory or learned patterns.
23. **Proactive Intervention Triggering (Based on Prediction):** Initiate actions based on the *prediction* of an event occurring, rather than waiting for the event itself.
24. **Optimized System Energy/Resource Management (Cross-Component):** Coordinate the activity levels and resource usage of multiple components to optimize overall system efficiency or meet specific constraints.

**Explanation:**

1.  **MCP Interface (`Component`):** The `Component` interface is the core of the MCP pattern here. Any module the agent needs to interact with must implement `ID()`, `Start()`, and `Stop()`. `Start` takes channels for receiving commands *from* the agent and sending events *to* the agent, plus a `context.Context` for graceful shutdown.
2.  **Agent (MCP):** The `Agent` struct holds a map of registered `Component` instances. It has internal channels (`componentCommandCh`, `componentEventCh`) for all component communication.
3.  **Communication:** `AgentCommand` and `ComponentEvent` structs are used for message passing. Commands include a `TargetComponentID` so components can filter messages on the shared channel. Events include a `SourceComponentID`.
4.  **Agent Lifecycle (`Start`, `Stop`, `run`):**
    *   `Start` registers components and launches a goroutine for each component's `Start` method, passing the shared command/event channels and the agent's context. It also launches the agent's own `run` goroutine.
    *   `Stop` cancels the shared context, signaling all goroutines (agent `run` and component `Start` methods) to shut down gracefully. It then waits for them to finish using a `sync.WaitGroup`.
    *   `run` is the agent's main event loop. It listens on the `componentEventCh` (and potentially external inputs).
5.  **Decision Making (`handleComponentEvent`, `processLogic`):** When an event arrives (`handleComponentEvent`), the agent updates its internal state. The `processLogic` function (a simplified placeholder) examines the state and recent events to decide what to do next. This decision involves formulating `AgentCommand`s and dispatching them via `dispatchCommand`. This is where the logic for the 20+ advanced functions would *conceptually* reside – not as single methods, but as decision branches that coordinate multiple components.
6.  **Advanced Functions (Conceptual):** The list describes high-level capabilities. For example, "Hyperspectral Data Fusion" would involve a Sensor component receiving different data types, potentially a SensorFusion component combining them, and sending a "Fused Data Ready" event to the agent. The agent's `processLogic` would receive this, update state, and perhaps send a command to a Processor component for "Predictive Anomaly Detection".
7.  **Example Components (`Logger`, `Sensor`, `Processor`, `Effector`):** These are simple implementations demonstrating how a component receives commands, sends events, and respects the context for shutdown. They contain basic `log.Printf` statements and time delays to show the asynchronous interaction pattern. The `Sensor` component periodically sends events, including a simulated "ANOMALY_DETECTED" which triggers a command from the agent to the `Processor`. The `Processor` simulates analysis and might trigger the `Effector` if the result is "HIGH_RISK".
8.  **`main` Function:** Sets up logging, creates the agent, registers the example components, starts the agent, lets it run for a short time, and then stops it.

This structure provides a robust, modular foundation. Each component can be developed and tested independently, dealing with its specific domain (e.g., interacting with a database, running an ML model, controlling hardware). The agent focuses solely on orchestrating the flow of information and decisions between these components based on its internal state and goals. The listed "advanced functions" are realized by the agent leveraging the specific capabilities provided by its registered components through the defined MCP interface.
