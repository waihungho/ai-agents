# AI-Agent in Go: "CognitoVerse" - A Personalized Learning and Creative Companion

**Outline & Function Summary:**

This AI-Agent, named "CognitoVerse," is designed to be a personalized learning and creative companion. It goes beyond basic task automation and focuses on enhancing human creativity, learning, and exploration through advanced AI concepts.

**Core Functions:**

1.  **Personalized Learning Path Generation (`GenerateLearningPath`):** Creates customized learning paths based on user interests, skill level, and learning goals, drawing from diverse educational resources.
2.  **Adaptive Content Summarization (`AdaptiveSummarize`):** Summarizes complex documents or articles, adjusting the level of detail and language complexity based on the user's understanding and context.
3.  **Creative Idea Sparking (`SparkCreativeIdeas`):** Generates novel ideas and concepts for various creative domains (writing, art, music, problem-solving) by combining disparate concepts and leveraging creative algorithms.
4.  **Contextual Knowledge Expansion (`ContextualKnowledgeBoost`):**  Provides relevant background information and deeper insights into a topic the user is currently exploring, anticipating knowledge gaps.
5.  **Interactive Simulation & Scenario Exploration (`SimulateScenario`):**  Creates interactive simulations and "what-if" scenarios to allow users to explore potential outcomes and understand complex systems.
6.  **Personalized Language Tutor (`PersonalizedLanguageTutor`):**  Offers personalized language learning experiences, adapting to the user's learning style, pace, and focusing on relevant vocabulary and grammar based on their interests.
7.  **Ethical Dilemma Simulation & Reasoning (`SimulateEthicalDilemma`):** Presents ethical dilemmas and guides users through structured reasoning processes to explore different perspectives and develop ethical decision-making skills.
8.  **Interdisciplinary Concept Bridging (`BridgeInterdisciplinaryConcepts`):**  Identifies connections and analogies between concepts from different disciplines (e.g., physics and philosophy, biology and art), fostering a holistic understanding.
9.  **Personalized News & Information Curation (`PersonalizedNewsFeed`):** Curates a news and information feed tailored to the user's interests and learning goals, filtering out noise and prioritizing relevant content.
10. **Cognitive Bias Detection & Mitigation (`DetectCognitiveBias`):** Analyzes user input (text, choices) to identify potential cognitive biases and offers strategies to mitigate their influence in decision-making.
11. **Future Trend Forecasting (Domain-Specific) (`ForecastFutureTrends`):** Predicts potential future trends within a specific domain (e.g., technology, art, social trends) based on data analysis and expert insights.
12. **Personalized Skill Gap Analysis (`SkillGapAnalysis`):** Analyzes the user's current skills and desired career or learning path to identify specific skill gaps and recommend targeted development strategies.
13. **Creative Writing Prompt Generation (`GenerateCreativeWritingPrompts`):** Generates diverse and imaginative writing prompts to stimulate creative writing practice and exploration of different genres and styles.
14. **Personalized Argumentation & Debate Partner (`DebatePartner`):**  Acts as a debate partner, presenting counter-arguments and challenging the user's viewpoints in a constructive manner to sharpen critical thinking.
15. **Style Transfer for Creative Content (Beyond Images) (`StyleTransferCreativeContent`):** Applies style transfer techniques not only to images but also to text, music, or code, allowing users to experiment with creative expression in different styles.
16. **Personalized Project Idea Generation (`GenerateProjectIdeas`):** Suggests personalized project ideas aligned with the user's skills, interests, and learning goals, encouraging hands-on learning and portfolio building.
17. **Emotional Tone Analysis & Feedback (`AnalyzeEmotionalTone`):** Analyzes the emotional tone of user-generated text and provides feedback on emotional clarity and impact, useful for communication and creative writing.
18. **Personalized Metaphor & Analogy Generation (`GenerateMetaphorsAndAnalogies`):** Generates relevant and insightful metaphors and analogies to help users understand complex concepts or express ideas more creatively.
19. **Knowledge Graph Based Concept Exploration (`ExploreConceptKnowledgeGraph`):** Allows users to visually explore interconnected concepts within a knowledge graph, uncovering relationships and expanding their understanding of a domain.
20. **Personalized Feedback on Creative Work (`ProvideCreativeFeedback`):** Provides constructive and personalized feedback on user-created content (writing, art, code), focusing on areas for improvement and creative potential.
21. **Multi-Modal Learning Experience Design (`DesignMultiModalLearning`):** Creates learning experiences that integrate various media types (text, images, audio, video, interactive elements) to cater to different learning styles and enhance engagement.
22. **Personalized Goal Setting & Progress Tracking (`PersonalizedGoalSetting`):** Helps users define realistic and achievable learning or creative goals and provides tools for tracking progress and staying motivated.
