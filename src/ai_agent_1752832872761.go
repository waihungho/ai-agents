Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Creating a *truly* novel AI concept in Golang without using existing open-source ML frameworks (which is the hardest constraint, as most AI *implementations* rely on them) means we'll focus on advanced *algorithmic concepts*, *cognitive architectures*, and *system-level intelligence* rather than deep learning specifics. We'll simulate complex behaviors with simpler underlying Golang data structures and logic.

The "MCP Interface" (Master Control Program, implying a command-line or text-based interactive system) will be our primary interaction point.

## AI Agent: "CogniPath" - The Self-Evolving Cognitive Orchestrator

**Concept:** CogniPath is an AI agent designed not just to process data, but to understand its own operational context, adapt its internal heuristics, learn from subtle feedback, and orchestrate *self-modification* and *resource allocation* based on emergent system states. It leans into concepts like meta-learning, explainable AI (XAI) through self-reflection, and probabilistic reasoning.

**Core Philosophy:** Instead of fixed models, CogniPath operates on a dynamic graph-based knowledge representation, evolving decision heuristics, and a "self-awareness" layer that monitors its own performance and resource consumption to inform its adaptive strategies.

**MCP Interface:** A robust, interactive command-line interface that allows users to query the agent, provide feedback, and observe its internal state and reasoning processes.

### Outline and Function Summary

**I. Core Agent Architecture (`agent.go`)**
    *   `Agent` Struct: Manages internal state, knowledge base, memory, and cognitive modules.
    *   `NewAgent`: Initializes the agent with default configurations.

**II. Knowledge Representation & Memory (`knowledge.go`)**
    *   `KnowledgeBase` Struct: Stores interconnected facts and concepts. (Simple graph/map).
    *   `EphemeralMemory` Struct: Short-term, context-specific memory.

**III. Cognitive Functions (`cognitive.go`)**
    *   **A. Knowledge Acquisition & Management**
        1.  `IngestFact(subject, predicate, object string)`: Adds a new semantic triple to the knowledge base, updating graph connections.
        2.  `QueryRelational(subject, predicate string)`: Retrieves objects related to a subject via a predicate.
        3.  `EstablishContext(contextID string, facts []string)`: Loads specific facts into ephemeral memory, setting a working context.
        4.  `SynthesizeConcept(conceptName string, contributingFacts []string)`: Creates a new, abstract concept node by linking existing facts.
        5.  `RefineKnowledgeWeight(factID string, weight int)`: Adjusts the probabilistic "truth" weight or importance of a fact based on internal consistency or external feedback.
    *   **B. Reasoning & Inference**
        6.  `InferCausalLink(antecedent, consequent string)`: Attempts to deduce a causal link between two concepts based on co-occurrence and temporal data within the KB. (Simulated Bayesian inference).
        7.  `EvaluateHypothesis(hypothesis string, criteria []string)`: Assesses the plausibility of a user-provided hypothesis against current knowledge and internal heuristics, providing a confidence score.
        8.  `ProposeActionPlan(goal string, constraints []string)`: Generates a sequence of conceptual steps to achieve a goal, considering constraints and current state. (Simple pathfinding on knowledge graph).
        9.  `PrioritizeTasks(taskIDs []string, urgencyFactors map[string]float64)`: Orders tasks based on their estimated impact, urgency, and resource dependencies using a dynamic heuristic.
       10. `SimulateOutcome(action string, context string)`: Predicts potential direct and indirect consequences of a given action within a specified context, leveraging learned causality.
    *   **C. Learning & Adaptation (Self-Evolving)**
       11. `AdaptHeuristic(heuristicName string, feedback int)`: Modifies an internal decision-making heuristic's parameters (e.g., learning rate, bias) based on explicit or implicit feedback. (Meta-learning concept).
       12. `SelfOptimizeResourceAllocation(module string, desiredPerformance float64)`: Dynamically adjusts internal resource weighting (simulated CPU/memory priority) for cognitive modules based on observed performance and current demand.
       13. `IdentifyEmergentPattern(dataPoints []string, threshold float64)`: Detects recurring or anomalous patterns in incoming data streams or internal states that were not explicitly programmed. (Simple frequency analysis/clustering).
       14. `LearnFromFeedback(feedbackType string, payload string)`: Incorporates user feedback (e.g., "correct", "incorrect", "helpful") to update knowledge weights, adjust heuristics, or refine reasoning paths.
       15. `ConfigureAdaptiveThreshold(paramName string, sensitivity float64)`: Sets or adjusts an adaptive threshold for internal monitoring or decision-making parameters, allowing the agent to become more or less sensitive over time.
    *   **D. Self-Awareness & Explainability (XAI)**
       16. `InitiateSelfReflection(focusArea string)`: Triggers an internal process where the agent analyzes its recent performance, decisions, or knowledge consistency, identifying potential biases or gaps.
       17. `ExplainDecision(decisionID string)`: Provides a trace of the facts, inferences, and heuristics used to arrive at a particular decision or conclusion.
       18. `EstimateInternalConfidence(query string)`: Reports the agent's estimated confidence level in its own response or conclusion to a given query, based on the robustness of supporting evidence.
       19. `DiagnoseKnowledgeConflict()`: Scans the knowledge base for contradictory facts or conflicting inference paths and reports them for human review or self-resolution.
       20. `PredictSelfStateShift(input string)`: Forecasts how a new input or action might change the agent's internal state, cognitive load, or future decision-making tendencies.

**IV. MCP Interface (`mcp.go`)**
    *   `MCPInterface` Struct: Manages command parsing, user interaction loop, and agent interaction.
    *   `Run()`: Starts the interactive command-line loop.
    *   `ProcessCommand(command string)`: Parses user input and dispatches to the appropriate agent function.
    *   `DisplayHelp()`: Shows available commands and their usage.
