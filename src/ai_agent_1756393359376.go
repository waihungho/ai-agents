This AI Agent, named `MCPAgent` (Master Control Program Agent), is designed in Golang as a highly modular, self-aware, and adaptive orchestrator. It doesn't directly implement low-level AI algorithms (like neural networks or specific ML models) to avoid duplicating existing open-source libraries. Instead, its "intelligence" lies in its ability to act as a central brain that orchestrates various AI "modules" (which can be thought of as specialized AI microservices or internal capabilities). The MCPAgent's advanced concepts focus on meta-level intelligence, self-management, adaptive learning, and sophisticated interaction patterns.

**Core Concept:**

The `MCPAgent` functions as a sophisticated orchestrator, managing a dynamic ecosystem of specialized AI modules. Its primary role is to provide meta-level intelligence, enabling self-awareness, metacognitive learning, causal reasoning, ethical oversight, and adaptive resource management. By abstracting the underlying AI capabilities into `AIModule` interfaces, the `MCPAgent` focuses on *how* these capabilities are leveraged and coordinated to achieve complex goals, rather than *how* they are implemented. This approach ensures the solution is unique and does not duplicate existing open-source AI frameworks.

### Function Summaries (20 Functions):

1.  **`InitializeAgent(config types.AgentConfig) error`**
    Initializes the MCPAgent, loading its configuration, setting up internal state, and preparing its communication channels. This is the foundational step to bring the agent online.

2.  **`RegisterModule(name string, module types.AIModule) error`**
    Allows for the dynamic registration of specialized AI modules (e.g., a "Vision Module", "Language Understanding Module", "Decision Engine Module"). This makes the agent highly extensible, allowing it to acquire new capabilities on-the-fly.

3.  **`DeregisterModule(name string) error`**
    Removes a previously registered AI module, allowing the agent to dynamically unload capabilities that are no longer needed, might be malfunctioning, or require an update.

4.  **`ExecuteCognitiveCycle() error`**
    Triggers a comprehensive cognitive processing loop. This function orchestrates the sequential flow from perception (ingesting data), to reasoning (processing with registered cognitive modules), to decision-making, and finally to executing actions through registered action modules. It's the central operational loop of the agent.

5.  **`UpdateKnowledgeGraph(data map[string]interface{}) error`**
    Integrates new information into the agent's internal semantic knowledge graph. This graph is a structured representation of facts, relationships, and inferred understandings, constantly refined by new sensory input and reasoning processes.

6.  **`QueryKnowledgeGraph(query string) (interface{}, error)`**
    Retrieves structured information, inferred facts, or answers to complex questions from the agent's internal knowledge graph, leveraging its semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities.

7.  **`AssessEpistemicUncertainty(taskID string) (float64, error)`**
    Evaluates and quantifies the agent's confidence level or inherent uncertainty regarding a specific task, prediction, or piece of information. A high uncertainty might trigger active learning or further information seeking behaviors.

8.  **`PerformMetacognitiveSelfCorrection(errorLog []types.ErrorRecord) error`**
    Engages in metacognition by analyzing past operational errors, flawed predictions, or suboptimal decisions. It identifies patterns of failure and adjusts its internal reasoning heuristics, module parameters, or knowledge graph structure for future improvement.

9.  **`GenerateCounterfactualScenario(eventID string, hypotheticalChanges map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error)`**
    Simulates "what if" scenarios by altering parameters of past events. This helps the agent understand causal relationships, evaluate alternative actions, and improve future decision-making by learning from hypothetical outcomes.

10. **`ProposeGoalRecalibration(environmentDelta map[string]interface{}) ([]types.ProposedGoal, error)`**
    Monitors significant changes in the operating environment or system objectives. Based on these deltas, it proactively suggests adjustments or redefinitions of its own long-term goals or mission parameters to maintain relevance and effectiveness.

11. **`OrchestrateActiveLearningQuery(uncertaintyThreshold float64) ([]types.HumanQuery, error)`**
    Identifies situations where the agent's epistemic uncertainty exceeds a predefined threshold. It then intelligently formulates targeted questions or requests for clarification, acting as a human-in-the-loop mechanism to gain precise feedback and learn.

12. **`SynthesizeIntentDrivenActionPlan(intent string, context map[string]interface{}) ([]types.ActionStep, error)`**
    Translates a high-level, natural language (or symbolic) user/system intent into a concrete, executable sequence of actions. This involves dynamically selecting and orchestrating calls to various registered action modules or external APIs.

13. **`ExplainDecision(decisionID string, context map[string]interface{}) (types.Explanation, error)`**
    Generates a human-understandable justification for a specific decision or action taken by the agent. The explanation is tailored to the context of the query and the requesting user's assumed level of understanding, enhancing transparency and trust.

14. **`MonitorCognitiveLoad() (types.CognitiveLoadReport, error)`**
    Monitors the agent's internal computational resource usage, processing queues, and active task load. This function provides insight into the agent's current "mental" state and helps prevent overload and optimize performance.

15. **`AdaptResourceAllocation(taskPriority string, requiredResources map[string]interface{}) error`**
    Dynamically adjusts the allocation of computational resources (e.g., CPU, memory, specialized hardware like GPUs) to different internal tasks or modules based on their priority, current demands, and the agent's overall cognitive load.

16. **`DetectAndMitigateBias(outputID string) (types.BiasReport, error)`**
    Proactively scans the agent's generated outputs, decisions, or internal data processing for potential biases. If biases are detected, it suggests mitigation strategies or flags the output for human review, ensuring ethical and fair operation.

17. **`ForecastComplexSystemState(systemID string, horizon time.Duration) (map[string]interface{}, error)`**
    Analyzes historical and real-time data from a complex, dynamic system to predict its likely future states over a specified time horizon, leveraging advanced temporal pattern recognition and causal inference.

18. **`PerformMultiModalSemanticFusion(data []interface{}) (types.SemanticRepresentation, error)`**
    Integrates and synthesizes meaning from diverse data modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, time-series sensor data) into a unified, coherent semantic representation. It identifies inter-modal relationships and deep contextual understanding.

19. **`OrchestrateSwarmTask(task types.SwarmTaskConfig) (types.SwarmTaskResult, error)`**
    Coordinates and manages multiple, potentially specialized, AI sub-agents or distributed services (a "swarm") to collectively achieve a larger, more complex goal that a single agent might not be able to handle efficiently.

20. **`ShutdownAgent() error`**
    Gracefully terminates the MCPAgent, ensuring all ongoing tasks are completed or saved, internal state is persisted, and all registered modules are properly shut down and resources are released.
