AI Agent with MCP Interface in Golang

Outline and Function Summary:

This AI Agent, named "SynergyOS," is designed with a Message Channel Protocol (MCP) interface for communication.
It focuses on advanced, creative, and trendy functions, avoiding duplication of common open-source AI functionalities.
SynergyOS aims to be a versatile personal AI assistant, enhancing user creativity, productivity, and well-being.

Function Summary (20+ Functions):

1.  Personalized Narrative Generation: Creates unique stories or narratives based on user-defined themes, styles, and emotional tones.
2.  Adaptive Learning Path Curator:  Designs personalized learning paths based on user's knowledge gaps, learning style, and goals, dynamically adjusting to progress.
3.  Context-Aware Music Composition: Generates original music pieces that adapt to the user's current context (time of day, mood, activity, location).
4.  Creative Idea Spark Engine:  Provides novel and unexpected ideas for creative projects (writing, art, design, business) by combining disparate concepts.
5.  Style Transfer and Remixing (Beyond Images): Applies artistic styles to text, code, or even processes, and remixes existing content in innovative ways.
6.  Dynamic Storyboarding and Visualization: Creates visual storyboards from textual descriptions, dynamically adjusting based on user feedback and narrative flow.
7.  Environmental Context Analysis & Suggestion: Analyzes environmental data (weather, news, social media trends) and offers relevant and personalized suggestions or insights.
8.  Behavioral Pattern Recognition for Proactive Assistance: Learns user behavior patterns and proactively offers assistance or suggestions before being explicitly asked.
9.  Predictive Task Prioritization: Prioritizes user's tasks based on deadlines, importance, context, and predicted user energy levels and focus.
10. Emergent Goal Discovery: Helps users discover hidden or subconscious goals by analyzing their activities, interests, and stated values.
11. Simulated Environment Training & Rehearsal: Creates simulated environments for users to practice skills or rehearse complex tasks in a safe and controlled virtual setting.
12. Cognitive Bias Mitigation Assistant: Identifies potential cognitive biases in user's thinking and provides counter-arguments or alternative perspectives.
13. Empathic Response Generation for Communication:  Generates empathetic and emotionally intelligent responses in text or voice, tailored to the emotional tone of the conversation.
14. Multimodal Input Interpretation & Fusion:  Processes and integrates inputs from various modalities (text, voice, images, sensor data) for a richer understanding of user intent.
15. Proactive Suggestion & Assistance in Creative Processes:  Offers proactive suggestions and assistance during creative tasks (writing, coding, design) based on context and user style.
16. Causal Inference Engine for Problem Solving:  Analyzes complex situations to infer causal relationships and identify root causes of problems.
17. Scenario Planning & "What-If" Analysis:  Generates and analyzes various scenarios based on user-defined variables and assumptions for strategic planning.
18. Ethical Dilemma Simulation & Exploration:  Presents ethical dilemmas and simulates potential outcomes of different choices, aiding in ethical decision-making.
19. Personalized Skill Recommendation & Gap Analysis:  Analyzes user's skills, interests, and career goals to recommend relevant skills to learn and identify skill gaps.
20. Mindfulness & Reflection Prompts Generator:  Generates personalized mindfulness prompts and reflection questions to encourage self-awareness and mental well-being.
21. Personalized Feedback Loop for Skill Improvement:  Creates tailored feedback loops for skill improvement by analyzing user performance and providing targeted guidance.
22. Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction from User Interactions:  Builds a dynamic knowledge graph representing user's knowledge, interests, and connections, evolving with interactions.
