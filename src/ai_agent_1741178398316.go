# AI Agent in Golang - Cognitive Harmony Agent

**Outline and Function Summary:**

This AI Agent, named "Cognitive Harmony Agent," focuses on enhancing user well-being and cognitive balance in the digital world. It leverages advanced AI concepts to provide personalized, proactive, and creative assistance, going beyond typical task automation.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

1.  **Personalized Content Recommendation (Advanced):** Recommends content (articles, videos, music) based on deep user preference analysis, considering not just explicit likes but also implicit emotional states and cognitive load.

2.  **Adaptive Learning Path Generation:** Creates personalized learning paths for users based on their learning style, knowledge gaps (identified through dynamic assessment), and learning goals, adjusting in real-time based on progress and engagement.

3.  **Dynamic Task Prioritization (Cognitive Load Aware):** Prioritizes user tasks not just by deadlines but also by the user's current cognitive state (stress level, focus), suggesting optimal task order to minimize mental fatigue.

4.  **Sentiment-Aware Communication Assistant:** Analyzes the sentiment of incoming messages (emails, chats) and suggests appropriate and empathetic responses, even offering to rephrase messages to avoid miscommunication.

5.  **Style-Guided Text Generation (Creative Writing):**  Assists users in creative writing by generating text snippets or full drafts in a user-defined style (e.g., Hemingway, poetic, humorous), learning from user-provided examples.

6.  **Visual Metaphor Generation for Communication:**  When users struggle to explain abstract concepts, the agent can generate relevant visual metaphors (images, short animations) to aid in communication and understanding.

7.  **Personalized Soundscape Generation for Focus/Relaxation:** Creates dynamic and personalized soundscapes based on user's current environment, activity, and desired mental state (focus, relaxation, creativity), using generative audio models.

8.  **Multimodal Summary Generation (Text, Image, Audio):** Summarizes complex information from various sources (text documents, images, audio/video) into a concise, multimodal summary that caters to different learning preferences.

9.  **Contextual News Filtering and Bias Detection:** Filters news based on user interests but also actively identifies and flags potential biases in news sources and presents diverse perspectives on important topics.

10. **Cross-Lingual Information Synthesis:** Synthesizes information from multiple sources in different languages and provides a coherent summary in the user's preferred language, breaking down language barriers.

11. **Anomaly Detection in Personal Data (Wellbeing Focus):**  Monitors user's personal data (calendar, activity logs, communication patterns) to detect anomalies that might indicate potential issues like burnout, social isolation, or health concerns, providing proactive alerts.

12. **Insight Extraction from Unstructured Data (Personal Notes, Thoughts):** Analyzes user's unstructured data (notes, journal entries, voice memos) to extract key insights, identify recurring themes, and help users gain self-awareness.

13. **Dream Pattern Analysis (Experimental):**  If the user records dream journals (text or voice), the agent can analyze them for recurring themes, emotional patterns, and potential symbolic meanings, providing speculative insights (for entertainment and self-reflection).

14. **Creative Co-Writing with AI (Interactive Storytelling):**  Engages in interactive storytelling with the user, where the user provides prompts or initial story elements, and the AI collaboratively expands the narrative, offering creative twists and plot suggestions.

15. **Personalized Art Generation for Mood Enhancement:** Generates personalized digital art pieces (images, animations) based on the user's current mood, preferences, and even biometric data, aiming to uplift mood and provide visual stimulation.

16. **Ethical Bias Detection and Mitigation in User-Generated Content:**  Helps users review their own writing or creations for potential unintentional biases (gender, racial, etc.), suggesting more inclusive and balanced language.

17. **Proactive Task Suggestion based on Context and Goals:**  Proactively suggests tasks to the user based on their current context (time of day, location, ongoing projects, long-term goals), going beyond simple reminders to offer strategic task recommendations.

18. **Automated Digital Wellbeing Prompts and Exercises:**  Based on user activity and detected stress levels, triggers personalized digital wellbeing prompts (mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, screen break reminders) to promote mental and physical health.

19. **Context-Aware Smart Home Control (Cognitive Comfort):**  Integrates with smart home devices to dynamically adjust environmental settings (lighting, temperature, music) based on user's activity, mood, and preferences, aiming for optimal cognitive comfort.

20. **Personalized News Briefing Generation (Interest & Cognitive State Aware):** Generates personalized news briefings that are not only tailored to user interests but also consider their current cognitive state (e.g., shorter, more concise briefing when user is likely busy or stressed).

21. **Voice-Controlled Interface for Cognitive Agent Functions:**  Provides a natural language voice interface to interact with all the agent's functionalities, allowing for hands-free and intuitive control.

22. **Multimodal Input Processing for Enhanced Understanding:**  Processes user input from multiple modalities (text, voice, images) to gain a richer understanding of user requests and context.
