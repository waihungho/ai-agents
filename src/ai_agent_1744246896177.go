# AI Agent with MCP Interface in Golang

**Outline and Function Summary:**

This AI Agent, named "SynergyAI," is designed as a personalized and proactive assistant leveraging advanced AI concepts. It communicates via a Message Channel Protocol (MCP) for both receiving commands and sending responses/notifications.  SynergyAI focuses on enhancing user productivity, creativity, and well-being through a diverse set of functions, going beyond typical open-source AI agent functionalities.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

1.  **ReceiveMessage(message string) (string, error):** MCP interface function. Receives incoming messages/commands from external systems or users in string format.
2.  **SendMessage(message string) error:** MCP interface function. Sends outgoing messages/responses/notifications to external systems or users in string format.
3.  **ContextualUnderstanding(message string) string:**  Analyzes the input message within the agent's current and past interaction context to provide more relevant responses. Goes beyond keyword matching to understand intent and nuance.
4.  **ProactiveSuggestionGenerator() string:**  Based on user patterns and context, proactively suggests tasks, information, or actions the user might find helpful before being explicitly asked.
5.  **PersonalizedContentCuration(topic string) string:** Curates and summarizes online content (articles, news, research) based on the user's explicitly stated interests and implicitly learned preferences.
6.  **CreativeBrainstormingAssistant(topic string) string:**  Helps users brainstorm ideas for creative projects (writing, art, business ideas) by generating diverse and unconventional prompts and concepts.
7.  **AdaptiveLearningPathCreator(skill string) string:** Creates personalized learning paths for users to acquire new skills, considering their current knowledge level, learning style, and available resources.
8.  **EmotionalToneAnalyzer(text string) string:** Analyzes the emotional tone of text input and identifies underlying emotions (joy, sadness, anger, etc.) with nuanced categorization.
9.  **PersonalizedSummarization(document string, length string) string:** Summarizes long documents or articles into user-specified lengths, focusing on aspects most relevant to the user's profile.
10. **MultiModalInputProcessor(data interface{}) string:**  Processes various input types beyond text (e.g., images, audio) to understand user requests or extract information. (Interface{} for flexibility, specific types handled internally).
11. **ExplainableAIOutput(input string) string:** When providing AI-generated outputs (suggestions, summaries, etc.), provides a concise explanation of the reasoning behind the output, fostering trust and understanding.
12. **EthicalConsiderationChecker(task string) string:**  Evaluates a user's requested task against a built-in ethical framework and flags potential ethical concerns or biases, promoting responsible AI usage.
13. **SmartTaskDelegation(task string) string:** Analyzes complex tasks and intelligently delegates sub-tasks to specialized external services or simulated sub-agents for efficient completion.
14. **RealTimeInformationSynthesis(query string) string:** Gathers and synthesizes information from multiple real-time sources (news feeds, APIs, live data) to provide up-to-date and comprehensive answers.
15. **PredictiveMaintenanceAlert(systemData interface{}) string:** Analyzes system data (simulated in this example, could be sensor data in real applications) to predict potential failures or maintenance needs in advance.
16. **PersonalizedWellnessRecommendation() string:** Based on user data (simulated stress levels, activity patterns), provides personalized recommendations for wellness activities (mindfulness exercises, breaks, healthy recipes).
17. **InteractiveStorytellingGenerator(userPrompt string) string:** Generates interactive stories where user choices influence the narrative progression and outcome, providing engaging and personalized experiences.
18. **CodeSnippetGenerator(taskDescription string, language string) string:** Generates short code snippets in specified programming languages based on natural language task descriptions, aiding developers.
19. **PersonalizedArtStyleTransfer(imagePath string, style string) string:**  Applies a user-selected artistic style to a given image, creating personalized digital art pieces.
20. **"Dream Interpretation" (Creative AI) (dreamText string) string:**  Provides a creative and symbolic "interpretation" of user-described dreams, focusing on potential themes and metaphors rather than literal analysis (for entertainment and creative inspiration).
21. **PrivacyPreservingDataHandling(data interface{}) string:**  Ensures user data is handled with privacy in mind, outlining data anonymization and security measures (in a real implementation, this would be a core architectural aspect, here summarized as a function to describe its importance).
22. **FewShotLearningAdaptation(taskDescription string, examples interface{}) string:** Demonstrates the ability to quickly adapt to new tasks with only a few examples provided by the user, showcasing advanced learning capabilities.


**Note:** This code provides a structural outline and function summaries.  The actual implementation of each function, especially the AI-driven ones, would require significant AI/ML libraries and potentially external API integrations, which are beyond the scope of this outline.  This focuses on the conceptual design and interface of the AI agent.
