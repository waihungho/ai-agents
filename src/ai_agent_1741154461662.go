# AI Agent Outline:

This code provides a basic outline for the SynergyAI agent. Each function is defined as a method on the `SynergyAI` struct.
The `// TODO: Implement ...` comments indicate where the actual logic for each function should be implemented.
This is a conceptual outline, and the actual implementation would require significant effort and integration with various AI/ML libraries and data sources.
