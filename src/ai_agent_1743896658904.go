Outline and Function Summary:

**Agent Name:**  SynergyAI - The Adaptive Cognitive Companion

**Core Concept:** SynergyAI is designed as a highly adaptable and personalized AI agent that leverages advanced AI concepts to enhance user experience across various domains. It focuses on proactive assistance, insightful analysis, creative generation, and ethical AI practices.  Its MCP interface allows for seamless integration and communication with other systems or user interfaces.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

**Content & Creative Generation:**

1.  **Personalized Narrative Generation (GENERATE_NARRATIVE):** Creates unique stories, poems, or scripts tailored to user preferences (genre, style, themes). Goes beyond simple template-based generation, employing advanced language models for narrative depth and originality.
2.  **Multimodal Artistic Style Transfer (STYLE_TRANSFER):** Applies artistic styles (painting, music, writing) across different modalities (image to music, text to image, etc.).  Explores cross-modal creativity.
3.  **Dynamic Music Composition (COMPOSE_MUSIC):** Generates original music pieces based on user-defined moods, genres, or even environmental data (e.g., weather, time of day). Music adapts and evolves over time.
4.  **Interactive Code Generation (GENERATE_CODE):** Assists in coding by generating code snippets, suggesting algorithms, or even creating entire functions based on natural language descriptions and context.  Interactive and iterative refinement.

**Analysis & Insights:**

5.  **Contextual Sentiment Analysis (ANALYZE_SENTIMENT):**  Analyzes sentiment with deep contextual understanding, going beyond simple positive/negative. Detects sarcasm, irony, nuanced emotions, and cultural contexts.
6.  **Trend Forecasting & Predictive Analytics (FORECAST_TRENDS):**  Analyzes large datasets to predict emerging trends in various domains (social media, markets, technology).  Provides probabilistic forecasts with confidence intervals.
7.  **Complex Relationship Mapping (MAP_RELATIONSHIPS):**  Identifies and visualizes complex relationships and dependencies within data (social networks, knowledge graphs, system logs).  Reveals hidden connections and patterns.
8.  **Personalized Knowledge Graph Construction (BUILD_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH):** Dynamically builds a knowledge graph tailored to the user's interests and activities, connecting information from various sources and personal data.

**Personalization & Adaptation:**

9.  **Adaptive Learning Path Creation (CREATE_LEARNING_PATH):**  Generates personalized learning paths based on user's skills, goals, learning style, and progress.  Dynamically adjusts based on performance and feedback.
10. **Proactive Task Prioritization (PRIORITIZE_TASKS):**  Intelligently prioritizes user's tasks based on deadlines, importance, context, and learned user behavior.  Suggests optimal task order and time allocation.
11. **Personalized Recommendation Engine (RECOMMEND_ITEM):**  Provides highly personalized recommendations (products, content, services) based on deep user profiling, context-aware filtering, and long-term preference learning.
12. **Dynamic Interface Customization (CUSTOMIZE_INTERFACE):**  Adapts the user interface (layout, content, features) of connected applications based on user behavior, context, and predicted needs.

**Ethical & Explainable AI:**

13. **Bias Detection & Mitigation (DETECT_BIAS):**  Analyzes data and AI models for potential biases (gender, racial, etc.) and suggests mitigation strategies to ensure fairness and equity.
14. **Explainable AI Output (EXPLAIN_DECISION):**  Provides clear and understandable explanations for AI decisions and recommendations, fostering trust and transparency.  Offers different levels of explanation detail.
15. **Ethical Dilemma Simulation (SIMULATE_DILEMMA):**  Presents ethical dilemmas and facilitates discussions or simulations to explore different ethical perspectives and decision-making processes.

**Advanced Agent Capabilities:**

16. **Cross-Lingual Communication Bridge (TRANSLATE_COMMUNICATE):**  Facilitates real-time communication across languages, not just translation but also cultural context adaptation for smoother interaction.
17. **Multimodal Data Fusion & Reasoning (FUSE_DATA):**  Combines and reasons with data from multiple modalities (text, image, audio, sensor data) to derive richer insights and make more informed decisions.
18. **Anomaly Detection & Proactive Alerting (DETECT_ANOMALY):**  Monitors data streams and detects anomalies or unusual patterns, proactively alerting users to potential issues or opportunities.
19. **Robustness & Adversarial Attack Defense (DEFEND_ATTACK):**  Improves the robustness of AI models against adversarial attacks and ensures reliable performance in noisy or malicious environments.
20. **Federated Learning & Collaborative Intelligence (COLLABORATE_LEARN):**  Participates in federated learning scenarios, collaboratively training models with other agents without sharing raw data, contributing to collective intelligence.
21. **Simulated Environment Interaction (INTERACT_ENVIRONMENT):**  Can interact with simulated environments (games, virtual worlds, simulations) to learn, test strategies, or provide assistance within those contexts. (Bonus function to exceed 20)


**MCP Interface:**

*   Uses simple string-based messages for requests and responses.
*   Request format: `COMMAND [ARGUMENT1] [ARGUMENT2] ...`
*   Response format: `OK [DATA]` or `ERROR [MESSAGE]`
*   Commands correspond to the functions listed above.


**Go Implementation Notes:**

*   This is a simplified outline and placeholder implementation.
*   Real AI functionality would require integration with various AI/ML libraries and potentially external services.
*   Error handling and input validation are basic for demonstration purposes.
*   Concurrency and efficiency are not optimized in this example.
