## GoLAIA: Meta-Cognitive Autonomous Agent

### Project Outline

**Name:** GoLAIA (Go-Lang Autonomous Intelligence Agent)

**Core Concept:** GoLAIA is an advanced AI agent built around a **Meta-Cognitive Processor (MCP) Interface**. The MCP acts as the agent's central cognitive orchestration layer, providing self-awareness, self-regulation, and meta-learning capabilities. It doesn't just execute tasks; it understands its own internal state, adapts its strategies, manages resources, and learns how to learn more effectively. This design emphasizes introspection, strategic planning, ethical oversight, and
