**Explanation:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:**  The code starts with a comprehensive outline and function summary as requested, clearly explaining the structure and purpose of each function.
2.  **MCP Interface (Channels):**
    *   `RequestMessage` and `ResponseMessage` structs define the structure of messages exchanged with the agent. They use JSON tags for potential serialization if needed in a real-world scenario.
    *   `RequestChannel` (chan RequestMessage) is used to send requests *to* the agent.
    *   `ResponseChannel` (chan ResponseMessage) is used to receive responses *from* the agent.
3.  **AIAgent Struct:**
    *   Holds the `RequestChannel`, `ResponseChannel`, and `userProfile` (as an example of internal state).  You can extend this to include knowledge bases, model instances, etc., for a more complex agent.
4.  **NewAIAgent() and Start():**
    *   `NewAIAgent()` creates and initializes the agent, crucially starting the `handleRequests` goroutine which is the heart of the MCP listener.
    *   `Start()` simply prints a startup message and then enters a `select {}` block to keep the main goroutine alive so the agent can continue to process requests in the background.
5.  **handleRequests():**
    *   This is a **goroutine** that continuously listens on the `RequestChannel`.
    *   For each received `RequestMessage`, it uses a `switch` statement to route the request to the corresponding function based on the `Function` name in the request.
    *   It calls the appropriate agent function (e.g., `PersonalizedContentCurator`), gets the `ResponseMessage`, and sends it back on the `ResponseChannel`.
    *   Includes a `default` case to handle unknown function names and return an error.
6.  **Function Implementations (Stubs):**
    *   Each function (e.g., `PersonalizedContentCurator`, `CreativeIdeaGenerator`, etc.) is implemented as a **stub**.
    *   They currently just print a message indicating they were called and return a placeholder `ResponseMessage` with a simulated result.
    *   **In a real application, you would replace these stubs with actual AI logic.** This is where you would integrate NLP libraries, machine learning models, knowledge graph access, etc., to perform the intended function.
7.  **Example Usage in `main()`:**
    *   Creates a new `AIAgent`.
    *   Sends several example `RequestMessage`s to the agent's `RequestChannel` for different functions.
    *   Receives the `ResponseMessage`s from the `ResponseChannel` and prints the results (or errors).
    *   Includes an example of sending a request for an unknown function to demonstrate error handling.
    *   Uses `time.Sleep()` to keep the `main()` function running long enough to see the agent process the requests (in a real application, you'd likely have a more persistent application or a different way to manage agent lifecycle).

**To make this a real AI agent:**

*   **Implement the AI Logic:** Replace the function stubs with actual AI algorithms, models, and data processing code. This is the core AI development part. You would use Go libraries or potentially interface with external AI services or models (e.g., via APIs).
*   **Data Storage and Management:** Implement mechanisms to store user profiles, knowledge bases, training data, and any other data the agent needs to operate effectively.
*   **Error Handling and Robustness:** Improve error handling, logging, and make the agent more robust to handle unexpected inputs or failures.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** Consider scalability and performance if you need to handle a large number of requests or complex AI tasks. You might need to optimize code, use concurrency effectively, or consider distributed architectures.
*   **Security:** If the agent handles sensitive data or interacts with external systems, implement appropriate security measures.
