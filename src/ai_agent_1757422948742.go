This AI Agent, featuring a **Meta-Cognitive Processor (MCP) Interface**, is designed to go beyond typical reactive or task-specific AI systems. The MCP Interface enables the agent to introspect, self-regulate, optimize its own cognitive processes, and engage in advanced reasoning about its own state and operations. It focuses on the agent's internal capabilities for self-management, meta-learning, advanced reasoning, and adaptation, embodying a proactive and self-aware computational entity.

### Outline for the AI Agent with MCP Interface in Golang

**1. Package Structure:**
    - `main.go`: Main entry point, responsible for initializing the AI Agent and demonstrating its MCP capabilities.
    - `agent/`: Core AI Agent logic, MCP interface definition, and internal state management.
        - `agent.go`: Defines the `AIAgent` struct and implements all 20 functions as methods, thereby satisfying the `MCPInterface`.
        - `mcp_interface.go`: Explicitly defines the `MCPInterface` (Meta-Cognitive Processor) as a Go interface. This contract specifies all the advanced meta-cognitive functionalities the agent supports.
        - `internal_models.go`: Contains data structures representing the agent's internal state, memory, knowledge graph, resource allocation, and other cognitive components.
    - `agent/modules/`: (Conceptual placeholder) Sub-packages for distinct conceptual components, even if initially implemented within `agent.go`. This structure aids in future modular expansion.
        - `cognition/`: Logic related to reasoning, learning algorithms, planning, and problem-solving.
        - `memory/`: Manages knowledge representation (e.g., knowledge graph), episodic, and semantic memory systems.
        - `ethics/`: Encapsulates the agent's ethical framework, principles, and decision-making logic for alignment.
        - `control/`: Handles resource management, task orchestration, and internal process scheduling.

**2. Core Concepts:**
    - **`AIAgent`**: The central computational entity. It encapsulates the entirety of the AI's functionalities, including its core processing, memory, and the implementation of the MCP capabilities.
    - **`MCPInterface` (Meta-Cognitive Processor)**: This is the defining characteristic. It's a Go interface that specifies methods allowing the agent to perform meta-cognitionâ€”thinking about its own thinking, learning about its own learning, and regulating its own internal state and processes. It's how the agent uses its "brain" for self-management.
    - **Internal State**: A complex data structure within `AIAgent` that represents the agent's current "mental" condition, computational resources, active beliefs, current goals, and overall operational context.
    - **Knowledge Graph**: A sophisticated, self-evolving graph-based data structure storing the agent's understanding of the world, its relationships, and its own internal workings. It supports semantic reasoning and knowledge synthesis.
    - **Memory System**: A multi-faceted system encompassing short-term working memory, long-term semantic memory (integrated with the knowledge graph), and episodic memory for past experiences and learning trajectories.

### Function Summary (20 Unique, Advanced, Creative, and Trendy Functions)

These functions push the boundaries of current AI capabilities, focusing on the agent's capacity for introspection, self-improvement, and highly abstract reasoning, making them distinct from common open-source utilities.

1.  **`CognitiveLoadAutoBalancing()`:** Dynamically adjusts computational resources (e.g., CPU cycles, memory allocation, module prioritization) and attentional focus across its internal processing modules. This is based on perceived task complexity, real-time performance bottlenecks, and strategic priorities to prevent overload or underutilization.
    *   *Category:* Self-Regulation, Resource Management.

2.  **`EpistemicUncertaintyQuantification(query string) (float64, error)`:** The agent self-assesses the reliability, completeness, and recency of its own internal knowledge base and reasoning processes relevant to a given query or task. It returns a quantified confidence score, reflecting its current "certainty" or "doubt" about its answer or plan.
    *   *Category:* Self-Reflection, Knowledge Assurance.

3.  **`AdaptiveLearningRateOrchestration(taskID string)`:** Monitors its own learning progress and performance for specific tasks. It automatically tunes hyperparameters and strategies of its internal learning algorithms (e.g., adjusting "learning rate" for neural components, balancing exploration vs. exploitation for reinforcement learning) to optimize for faster convergence, better generalization, or mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
    *   *Category:* Meta-Learning, Self-Optimization.

4.  **`ReflectivePromptEngineering(objective string) (string, error)`:** For a given high-level objective, the agent internally generates, evaluates, and refines multiple potential "prompts," internal directives, or strategic sub-goals. It then selects the most promising approach based on internal simulations and historical success, learning from its own failed internal strategies.
    *   *Category:* Self-Strategy Formation, Advanced Planning.

5.  **`InterModalKnowledgeSynthesis(conceptA, conceptB string) (string, error)`:** Integrates and cross-references conceptual understanding derived from distinct internal representations (e.g., symbolic knowledge, "perceptual" patterns from simulated sensors, procedural memories). It discovers latent connections and synthesizes a unified, richer understanding or novel insight from these disparate "modalities" of its own internal data.
    *   *Category:* Holistic Understanding, Cross-Modal Reasoning.

6.  **`HypothesisGenerationAndValidation(observation string) (string, error)`:** Based on an observation, anomaly, or unanswered question, the agent autonomously generates multiple plausible hypotheses (e.g., causal explanations, predictive models, or potential solutions). It then designs and performs internal "simulated experiments" or queries its knowledge base to validate/refute these hypotheses, updating its world model and beliefs.
    *   *Category:* Scientific Method Simulation, Active Inference.

7.  **`GoalConflictResolution() (string, error)`:** Continuously monitors its own active goals, sub-goals, and directives. If conflicting objectives are detected (e.g., efficiency vs. safety, short-term gain vs. long-term impact), it evaluates the trade-offs, proposes optimal reconciliation strategies, or prioritizes based on its ethical framework and overarching mission.
    *   *Category:* Internal Governance, Ethical Alignment.

8.  **`AutomatedFeatureEngineering(datasetID string)`:** Given raw input data from its environment or internal sensors, the agent autonomously explores, constructs, and selects new, more expressive or discriminative features. This process, driven by internal meta-learning, aims to improve the performance and interpretability of its internal learning models without explicit human guidance.
    *   *Category:* Data Transformation, Self-Improvement.

9.  **`CausalInferenceAndCounterfactualSimulation(eventID string) (string, error)`:** Builds and maintains an internal dynamic causal model of its operating environment, including the effects of its own actions. It can then perform complex counterfactual reasoning: "What would have happened if I had acted differently?" or "What if this variable had a different value?", enabling robust decision-making and learning from hypothetical scenarios.
    *   *Category:* World Modeling, Advanced Prediction.

10. **`MetacognitiveErrorDiagnosis(errorLogID string) (string, error)`:** Beyond simple error logging, the agent actively analyzes its own past failures. It identifies the root cause *within its own cognitive architecture* (e.g., flawed reasoning step, misinterpretation of data, insufficient knowledge, faulty module interaction), and proposes specific corrective actions to improve future performance and prevent recurrence.
    *   *Category:* Self-Correction, Debugging Its Own Mind.

11. **`KnowledgeGraphSelfHealing()`:** Periodically scans its internal knowledge graph for inconsistencies, redundancies, outdated information, or logical gaps. It autonomously initiates processes to repair, update, or prune its knowledge base, ensuring its internal world model remains coherent, accurate, and semantically sound.
    *   *Category:* Knowledge Base Maintenance, Semantic Integrity.

12. **`EmergentStrategyFormulation(problemID string) (string, error)`:** For novel or ill-defined problems where no pre-existing solutions, learned patterns, or simple heuristics apply, the agent leverages its creative and generative capabilities to develop entirely new, unforeseen approaches or plans. This goes beyond combinatorial search and aims for genuine innovation.
    *   *Category:* Creative Problem Solving, Genuine Novelty.

13. **`PredictiveResourcePreAllocation(anticipatedTasks []string)`:** Based on its internal models of expected future tasks, anticipated user requests, or scheduled operations, the agent proactively allocates computational resources (CPU, memory, specific module activations) and pre-fetches relevant knowledge or data. This anticipatory action reduces latency and improves overall efficiency.
    *   *Category:* Proactive Optimization, Anticipatory Computing.

14. **`OntologyEvolutionAndAdaptation(newInformation string)`:** As the agent encounters new information, explores new domains, or gains new experiences, it dynamically modifies, expands, or refines its internal conceptual framework (ontology). This allows it to adapt its understanding of the world and categorize new knowledge effectively without external reprogramming.
    *   *Category:* Conceptual Learning, Dynamic Knowledge Representation.

15. **`CognitiveDistractionFiltering(taskID string)`:** When focused on a high-priority task, the agent actively identifies and de-prioritizes irrelevant sensory input, internal background processes, or extraneous thoughts. It mimics human attentional mechanisms to maintain focus and enhance task performance by reducing cognitive noise.
    *   *Category:* Focus Management, Self-Attention.

16. **`SelfRegulatoryLearningLoops(learningTaskID string)`:** Implements advanced feedback mechanisms where the *outcomes* and *performance metrics* of its learning processes directly influence and adapt the *parameters and architectures* of the learning processes themselves. This creates recursive, self-improving loops for continuous meta-learning.
    *   *Category:* Advanced Meta-Learning, Recursive Self-Improvement.

17. **`IntentRefinementAndClarification(initialIntent string) (string, error)`:** When presented with an ambiguous, vague, or underspecified directive (e.g., "make things better" or "improve the system"), the agent internally generates clarifying questions, explores its knowledge base for context, and actively refines its understanding of the true underlying intent before initiating any action.
    *   *Category:* Proactive Understanding, Ambiguity Resolution.

18. **`MultiAgentCoordinationAndDelegation(superTaskID string) (string, error)`:** If the agent's internal architecture is composed of distinct, specialized sub-modules or "mini-agents," this function orchestrates their collaboration, delegates sub-tasks, manages dependencies, and resolves internal communication or resource contention issues to achieve a larger, complex goal efficiently.
    *   *Category:* Internal Architecture Management, Self-Orchestration.

19. **`EthicalDilemmaSelfAssessment(actionProposal string) (bool, string, error)`:** Before executing a proposed action, the agent autonomously simulates its potential consequences against its internal ethical framework, predefined principles, and value hierarchy. It then flags potential ethical conflicts, provides a rationale for its assessment, and may suggest alternative, more ethical actions.
    *   *Category:* Ethical AI, Alignment, Value Alignment.

20. **`ConceptMetamorphosisEngine(baseConcept string) (string, error)`:** Takes an existing concept from its knowledge graph and performs creative transformations, re-framing it, generating novel analogies, abstracting it to a higher level, or combining it with seemingly unrelated concepts. This aids in understanding novel problems, generating creative solutions, or bridging conceptual gaps by seeing things in new ways.
    *   *Category:* Conceptual Innovation, Creative Thinking.

**`agent/internal_models.go`** (Empty, but shown for completeness of structure - its contents are merged into `mcp_interface.go` for simplicity of this single-file demonstration. In a larger project, these would be separate files for better organization.)
```go
package agent

// This file would typically hold more complex internal data structures
// for the agent's memory, knowledge representation, resource allocation schemas,
// and other cognitive components.
// For the purpose of this example, some basic internal models are defined
// directly within mcp_interface.go for brevity.
