**Explanation and Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **MCP Interface:** The `HandleCommand` function acts as the MCP interface. It receives text commands, parses them, and routes them to the appropriate function within the `AIAgent` struct. This is a simple text-based MCP, but in a real system, it could be more structured (e.g., using JSON or protocol buffers) and potentially over a network.

2.  **Personalization:** Several functions are designed for personalization:
    *   **Personalized News Curator:** Learns user interests and tailors news summaries.
    *   **Personalized Music Playlist Generator (Mood-Based):** Adapts music selection to the user's mood.
    *   **Personalized Learning Path Creation:** Creates learning paths based on user learning style and goals.
    *   **Adaptive User Interface Customization:** (Conceptual) Dynamically adjusts UI based on user preferences.
    *   **Personalized Humor Generation:** Attempts to tailor humor to the user's sense of humor.

3.  **Context Awareness:**
    *   **Contextual Reminder System:** Sets reminders triggered by location or activity context (simulated).
    *   **Sentiment-Aware Communication Assistant:** Provides real-time feedback based on sentiment.

4.  **Proactive and Predictive:**
    *   **Predictive Task Management:** Anticipates user tasks based on habits.
    *   **Proactive Cybersecurity Threat Detection:** (Conceptual) Monitors for threats and alerts proactively.

5.  **Creative and Generative:**
    *   **Creative Story Generator:** Generates original stories based on prompts.
    *   **Interactive Code Generation:** Generates code from natural language.
    *   **Personalized Humor Generation:** Generates jokes and humorous content.

6.  **Advanced AI Concepts (Simulated):**
    *   **Dynamic Skill Learning:** Agent can conceptually learn new skills over time.
    *   **Ethical Bias Detector (Text):** Addresses ethical concerns in AI by detecting biases in text.
    *   **Explainable AI Insights:** Aims to make AI decisions more transparent by providing explanations.
    *   **Hypothetical Scenario Simulation:** Uses AI to simulate "what-if" scenarios.
    *   **Multimodal Input Handling:**  (Conceptual) Agent can process different input types (text, image, audio).
    *   **Emotional Tone Adjustment in Output:**  Agent can adjust its output to match emotional context.

7.  **Trendy Functions:** The functions touch upon current trends in AI:
    *   **Personalization:**  Key trend in AI applications.
    *   **Generative AI:** Story generation, code generation, humor generation.
    *   **Contextual AI:** Context-aware reminders, sentiment analysis.
    *   **Ethical AI:** Bias detection.
    *   **Explainable AI:**  Transparency in AI decisions.
    *   **Multimodal AI:** Handling different data types.
    *   **Proactive Agents:** Agents that anticipate needs and act proactively.

**To Run the Code:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.go` file (e.g., `cognito_agent.go`).
2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal in the directory where you saved the file and run: `go build cognito_agent.go`
3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled binary: `./cognito_agent` (or `cognito_agent.exe` on Windows).
4.  **Interact:** Type commands at the `>` prompt and press Enter. Use `help` to see available commands and `exit` to quit.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Simulated Functionality:**  This code provides a conceptual outline. The actual AI logic within each function is heavily simplified and simulated. To make it a real AI Agent, you would need to replace the simulation comments with actual AI models, APIs, and data processing logic.
*   **Scalability and Complexity:** For a production-ready AI agent, you would need to consider scalability, error handling, more robust input parsing, state management, and potentially a more sophisticated MCP interface (e.g., using gRPC or similar technologies).
*   **Ethical Considerations:** When implementing real-world AI agents, especially in areas like health, finance, or security, it's crucial to address ethical considerations, data privacy, and potential biases in AI models.
