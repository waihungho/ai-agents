This AI Agent is designed with a **Modular Command & Control Plane (MCP)** interface, allowing for a highly flexible, extensible, and adaptive architecture. Each advanced AI capability is encapsulated as a `Module`, which the central `MasterControlProgram` (MCP) orchestrates. This design promotes clear separation of concerns, easy integration of new functionalities, and dynamic routing of requests to the most appropriate AI component.

### AI Agent Outline and Function Summary

**Overall Architecture:**
The AI Agent is built around a `MasterControlProgram (MCP)` acting as its central nervous system. It manages and orchestrates various `Module` components, each representing a distinct AI capability.

*   **`AgentContext`**: A shared context object providing common resources (logger, shared data store, event bus) to all modules, facilitating inter-module communication and shared state.
*   **`AgentRequest`**: A standardized struct for all incoming commands, queries, or events
