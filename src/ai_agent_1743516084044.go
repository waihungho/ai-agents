**MCP Interface Design:**

The MCP interface will be JSON-based for simplicity and flexibility.

**Request Message Structure (Sent to Cognito):**

```json
{
  "action": "function_name",
  "payload": {
    "param1": "value1",
    "param2": "value2",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Response Message Structure (Sent from Cognito):**

```json
{
  "status": "success" or "error",
  "result": {
    "output1": "output_value1",
    "output2": "output_value2",
    ...
  },
  "error_message": "if status is 'error', error details here"

}
```

**Explanation and How to Run:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:** The code starts with a detailed outline and summary of the AI agent's functions, as requested. This acts as documentation and a high-level overview.
2.  **MCP Interface Definition:** The `MCPRequest` and `MCPResponse` structs define the JSON-based communication protocol.
3.  **Agent Structure:** The `Agent` struct is created to hold the agent's state (currently just a name and a placeholder for `UserProfiles`). In a real agent, you'd store models, databases, etc., here.
4.  **`NewAgent()` Function:** A constructor for creating `Agent` instances.
5.  **`handleMCPRequest()` Function:** This is the HTTP handler function that receives MCP requests at the `/mcp` endpoint.
    *   It validates the request method (POST).
    *   Decodes the JSON request into an `MCPRequest` struct.
    *   Uses a `switch` statement to route the request to the appropriate function based on the `action` field.
    *   Calls the corresponding agent function (e.g., `agent.PersonalizedNewsCurator()`).
    *   Encodes the `MCPResponse` back to JSON and sends it as the HTTP response.
6.  **`sendErrorResponse()` Function:** A helper function to send consistent error responses in JSON format.
7.  **Function Implementations (Illustrative):**
    *   Functions like `PersonalizedNewsCurator`, `CreativeStoryteller`, `ProactiveTaskSuggester`, `EmotionalToneAnalyzer`, and `PersonalizedLearningPathCreator` are implemented as examples.
    *   **Crucially, these are using *simulated AI logic* and placeholder responses.**  They are designed to demonstrate the structure, function signatures, and MCP interface interaction, *not* to be fully functional AI features.
    *   **In a real AI agent, you would replace the `// **Simulated AI Logic:**` sections with calls to actual AI/ML libraries, models, APIs, and algorithms.** This would involve integrating libraries for NLP, machine learning, data analysis, etc. (e.g., libraries for natural language processing, deep learning frameworks, etc.).  The `github.com/google/uuid` import is just a placeholder example of a utility library you might use; you'd need to import and use actual AI/ML libraries relevant to your chosen functions.
8.  **`main()` Function:**
    *   Creates an `Agent` instance.
    *   Sets up the HTTP route handler using `http.HandleFunc("/mcp", agent.handleMCPRequest)`.
    *   Starts the HTTP server using `http.ListenAndServe()`. It uses the `PORT` environment variable for deployment or defaults to port 8080.

**To Run:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code as `main.go`.
2.  **Install Dependencies (if any real AI libraries were added - for this example, none are strictly needed):**
    ```bash
    go mod init cognito-agent  # Initialize Go modules (if not already in a module)
    go mod tidy              # Download dependencies (if any were added to imports)
    ```
3.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
    The agent will start listening on `http://localhost:8080/mcp` (or the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable).

**Testing with `curl` (Example for Personalized News Curator):**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "action": "personalized_news_curator",
  "payload": {
    "user_id": "user123",
    "interests": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Space Exploration", "Climate Change"]
  }
}' http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

**Important Notes for Real Implementation:**

*   **Replace Simulated Logic:** The core task is to replace the `// **Simulated AI Logic:**` sections in each function with actual AI/ML implementations. This will require:
    *   Choosing appropriate AI/ML libraries and models for each function.
    *   Training or fine-tuning models (if necessary).
    *   Integrating with external data sources (news APIs, social media APIs, etc.).
*   **Error Handling:**  Improve error handling throughout the code.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** For a production agent, consider scalability, performance optimization, and asynchronous processing, especially for long-running AI tasks.
*   **State Management:**  Implement robust state management for the agent (user profiles, learned data, etc.), potentially using databases or more advanced state management systems.
*   **Security:**  If the agent handles sensitive data, implement appropriate security measures.
*   **Modularity:** Break down complex functions into smaller, more modular components for better code organization and maintainability.

This example provides a solid foundation for building a creative and advanced AI agent with an MCP interface in Go. The key is to iteratively replace the placeholder AI logic with real, functional AI implementations to bring the agent's capabilities to life.
