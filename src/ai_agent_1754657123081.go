This is an ambitious and exciting request! Let's build a conceptual AI Agent in Golang with an MCP (Minecraft Client Protocol) interface, focusing on high-level, advanced, and unique AI functionalities.

The core idea is that this AI Agent doesn't just *play* Minecraft; it *interacts with and understands* a dynamic, simulated world via the MCP, applying sophisticated AI concepts. We'll define the MCP interface as an abstraction, so the specific underlying game client library (which would handle low-level packet serialization/deserialization) is pluggable and not part of this core AI logic. This fulfills the "don't duplicate any open source" by focusing on the *AI's decision-making and high-level interaction*, not the protocol implementation itself.

## AI Agent: "Chronos" - The Temporal Architect

**Concept:** Chronos is an AI agent designed not just to interact with its immediate environment but to understand, predict, and manipulate the temporal and spatial dynamics of the game world. It leverages advanced concepts like temporal graph neural networks, predictive modeling, generative design, and simulated socio-economic reasoning to achieve complex, long-term goals. It views the game world as a vast, evolving dataset.

**Interface:** MCP (Minecraft Client Protocol) - Abstracted for high-level interaction.
