**MCP Interface:**

The MCP is a simple text-based protocol.  Messages are strings.  The first word of the message is considered the command, and the rest of the message is the argument.  Responses are also strings.

Example MCP Interaction:

**Client (sends):** `CurateNews userID=user123 interests=technology,space,AI`
**Agent (responds):** `News Summary: ... (summarized news articles)`

**Client (sends):** `SuggestTasks userID=user123 context={"time": "morning", "location": "home", "calendar": "busy"}`
**Agent (responds):** `Task Suggestions: ... (suggested tasks)`

**Explanation:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:**  The code starts with a detailed comment block outlining the agent's name, purpose, MCP interface description, and a list of 22 (more than the requested 20) distinct and interesting functions. Each function has a brief description and its expected input/output.

2.  **`AIAgent` Struct and `NewAIAgent`:**  Defines a basic `AIAgent` struct and a constructor. In a real-world application, this struct would hold the agent's state, loaded AI models, knowledge bases, etc.

3.  **`HandleMessage(message string) string`:** This is the core of the MCP interface.
    *   It takes a message string as input.
    *   It splits the message into the command (first word) and arguments (the rest of the string).
    *   It uses a `switch` statement to route the command to the appropriate agent function.
    *   It returns a string response, which would be sent back over the MCP.
    *   It includes error handling for unknown commands.

4.  **Function Implementations (Stubs):**
    *   Each function listed in the outline (`CurateNews`, `SuggestTasks`, `GenerateCreativeIdeas`, etc.) is implemented as a separate method on the `AIAgent` struct.
    *   **Crucially, these are currently just *stubs*.** They print a message to the console indicating which function was called and with what arguments.  They return placeholder string responses.
    *   **To make this a functional AI agent, you would replace the placeholder comments in each function with actual AI logic.** This logic could involve:
        *   Calling external APIs (news APIs, music streaming services, smart home platforms).
        *   Using local or remote AI models (for text summarization, sentiment analysis, language generation, etc.).
        *   Accessing and processing user data (preferences, context, history - handled carefully with privacy in mind).
        *   Implementing algorithms for recommendation, optimization, anomaly detection, etc.

5.  **`main()` Function (MCP Simulation):**
    *   Creates an instance of the `AIAgent`.
    *   Sets up a simple array of example MCP messages to simulate client requests.
    *   Loops through the messages, prints the received message, calls `agent.HandleMessage()` to process it, and prints the agent's response.
    *   This `main` function is a basic example of how you might test the MCP interface and the agent's command handling. In a real application, you would have a proper MCP listener (e.g., listening on a socket or using a message queue) to receive messages from clients and send responses back.

**To extend this into a real AI Agent:**

*   **Implement the AI Logic:**  The core task is to replace the stub implementations of the agent functions with actual AI algorithms and integrations. This is where you would use Go libraries for NLP, machine learning, data processing, API calls, etc., depending on the specific function.
*   **MCP Listener:** Implement a proper MCP listener (e.g., using Go's `net` package for sockets, or a message queue library like RabbitMQ or Kafka) to handle real-time communication with clients.
*   **State Management:**  Design how the agent will maintain state (user profiles, preferences, session data, learned information, etc.). Consider using databases or in-memory data structures.
*   **Error Handling and Robustness:**  Add more comprehensive error handling, logging, and mechanisms to make the agent robust and reliable in real-world scenarios.
*   **Security and Privacy:**  If the agent handles user data, implement appropriate security measures and privacy controls.

This example provides a solid foundation and a conceptual framework for building a feature-rich and trendy AI agent in Go with an MCP interface. The next steps would be to choose specific AI functionalities you want to focus on and implement the corresponding logic within the function stubs.
