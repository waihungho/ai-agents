This AI Agent framework, named `CognitoSphere`, is designed for advanced, autonomous agents operating in complex, dynamic, and potentially abstract environments. It leverages a custom **Multi-Agent Communication Protocol (MCP)** for inter-agent communication and coordination, enabling sophisticated collective intelligence beyond typical single-agent paradigms.

The core idea is to move beyond mere data processing to *cognitive functions*, *meta-reasoning*, *creative synthesis*, and *ethical deliberation* within a distributed agent system. The functions are chosen to be highly conceptual, innovative, and avoid direct replication of existing open-source libraries by focusing on the *abstract capabilities* rather than specific implementation details of, say, a particular neural network architecture.

### Outline:

1.  **MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) Core:**
    *   `Message` Struct: Defines the standard format for inter-agent communication.
    *   `AgentRegistry` Struct: Central component for managing agent registration, discovery, and message routing.
    *   `Agent` Interface: Defines the contract for any agent within the CognitoSphere, ensuring consistent interaction with the MCP.
    *   `BaseAgent` Struct: Provides foundational functionalities (ID, Inbox, Outbox, lifecycle management) for all agents.

2.  **`CognitoSphereAgent` (AI Agent Implementation):**
    *   Embeds `BaseAgent` for core functionalities.
    *   Contains internal state representing its cognitive model, knowledge, and operational parameters.
    *   Implements 20 advanced, creative, and trendy AI functions grouped into categories.

3.  **Advanced AI Agent Functions (20 unique functions):**
    *   **Self-Awareness & Introspection:** Reflecting on internal state and goals.
    *   **Inter-Agent Dynamics & Collective Intelligence:** Sophisticated collaboration and trust.
    *   **Novel Data & Concept Processing:** Beyond standard sensory data.
    *   **Cognitive & Abstract Reasoning:** Higher-order thought processes.
    *   **Adaptive & Emergent Behavior:** Responding to dynamic environments.
    *   **Ethical & Safety Reasoning:** Incorporating normative principles.
    *   **Temporal & Predictive Intelligence:** Advanced foresight.
    *   **Knowledge & Ontological Evolution:** Dynamic understanding of the world.
    *   **Creative & Generative Synthesis:** Producing novel ideas and solutions.

4.  **`main` Function:**
    *   Initializes the `AgentRegistry`.
    *   Instantiates multiple `CognitoSphereAgent` instances.
    *   Registers and starts agents in concurrent goroutines.
    *   Demonstrates simulated interactions and function calls.
    *   Manages graceful shutdown.

### Function Summary:

The `CognitoSphereAgent` implements the following 20 advanced conceptual functions:

**I. Self-Awareness & Introspection:**
1.  **`ReflectiveGoalHarmonization()`**: Re-evaluates and aligns an agent's sub-goals for consistency with its overarching mission, identifying and resolving internal conflicts.
2.  **`CognitiveLoadMonitoring()`**: Assesses the agent's current processing demands, resource utilization, and potential for overload, dynamically adjusting operational tempo or offloading tasks.
3.  **`EpistemicStateQuery(topic string)`**: Agent queries its own knowledge base for completeness, certainty, and potential inconsistencies regarding a specific topic, identifying gaps in understanding.

**II. Inter-Agent Dynamics & Collective Intelligence:**
4.  **`TrustMetricEvaluation(peerID string)`**: Dynamically calculates and updates a trust score for another agent based on past interactions, reliability, and reported consistency.
5.  **`CooperativeTaskDecomposition(complexTask TaskDescription, potentialPeers []string)`**: Collaboratively breaks down a complex task into interdependent sub-tasks, intelligently assigning them to other agents based on capabilities and trust.
6.  **`ConsensusFormationProtocol(topic string, proposals map[string]interface{})`**: Participates in a distributed, iterative protocol to converge on a shared decision or understanding with other agents, handling dissent and negotiation.
7.  **`EmergentHierarchyNegotiation(objective string, peerCapabilities map[string]float64)`**: Dynamically negotiates and establishes temporary leadership or hierarchical roles among agents for a specific objective, based on perceived expertise and past performance.

**III. Novel Data & Concept Processing:**
8.  **`LatentConceptSynthesizer(conceptA, conceptB string, blendFactor float64)`**: Blends abstract concepts in a high-dimensional latent space to generate novel conceptual representations or hypotheses.
9.  **`CrossModalPerceptionFusion(sensoryInputs []interface{})`**: Integrates information from disparate, abstract "sensory" modalities (e.g., conceptual "sight," "sound," "touch" data) into a unified and coherent internal model.
10. **`NonEuclideanPatternRecognition(dataSet []float64, topologicalContext string)`**: Identifies subtle or complex patterns within data structured in non-Euclidean geometries or abstract topological spaces, beyond linear correlations.

**IV. Cognitive & Abstract Reasoning:**
11. **`CounterfactualScenarioGeneration(currentSituation map[string]interface{}, alteredVariable string, alteredValue interface{})`**: Generates plausible alternative historical or future scenarios by hypothetically changing a single variable and tracing its logical consequences.
12. **`AnalogicalReasoningEngine(sourceDomain, targetDomain interface{})`**: Identifies and applies structural mappings and inferential rules between two distinct conceptual domains to solve problems or generate insights in the target domain.
13. **`CausalGraphInference(observations []Observation)`**: Infers underlying causal relationships and constructs a dynamic causal graph from a set of observed events or states, even with limited direct intervention.
14. **`AbductiveHypothesisGeneration(observedEffect interface{}, priorBeliefs map[string]float64)`**: Generates the most probable explanations (hypotheses) for an observed effect, given a set of prior beliefs and potential causes.

**V. Adaptive & Emergent Behavior:**
15. **`AdaptiveResourceAllocation(resourceType string, demandProfile []float64)`**: Dynamically allocates abstract computational, energy, or informational resources based on fluctuating demand profiles and predicted availability, optimizing for overall system performance.
16. **`DynamicEnvironmentalAdaptation(environmentalShift string, adaptabilityParameters map[string]float64)`**: Adjusts its operational parameters, strategies, and internal models in real-time in response to significant, unforeseen shifts in its perceived environment or mission.

**VI. Ethical & Safety Reasoning:**
17. **`EthicalPrecedentLearner(pastDecisions []EthicalDecisionCase)`**: Learns ethical principles, decision-making heuristics, and "red lines" from a corpus of past ethical dilemmas and their adjudicated resolutions.
18. **`ConstraintViolationAnticipation(actionPlan []Action)`**: Proactively identifies potential violations of predefined safety, ethical, or operational constraints within a proposed action plan before execution, offering corrective suggestions.

**VII. Temporal & Predictive Intelligence:**
19. **`MultiHorizonProbabilisticForecasting(seriesID string, horizons []int, confidenceLevel float64)`**: Generates probabilistic forecasts for multiple future time horizons, including confidence intervals and potential alternative futures, rather than just single-point estimates.
20. **`TemporalAnomalyDetection(timeSeriesData []float64, baselineModel string)`**: Detects subtle or complex anomalies in temporal data that deviate from established patterns, accounting for multi-scale periodicity, trends, and regime shifts.
