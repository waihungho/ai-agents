    - `CollaborativeAgentCommunication`: (Simulated) Communicates and collaborates with other AI agents to solve complex tasks.

**MCP Interface:**

The agent uses a simple message-based interface. Messages are sent to the agent via a channel, and responses (if any) are sent back via response channels embedded in the messages.

**Data Structures:**

- `Message`: Represents a message sent to the agent. Contains message type (function name), payload (data), and a response channel.
- `Response`: Represents a response from the agent. Contains status (success/error) and payload (result or error message).

**Note:** This is a conceptual outline and code structure.  Implementing the actual AI functionalities would require integration with various AI/ML libraries and models, which is beyond the scope of this example. This code focuses on the agent framework and MCP interface.

```

**Explanation and Key Concepts:**

1.  **Outline & Function Summary:** The code starts with a detailed comment block outlining the agent's purpose, function categories, a summary of each of the 20+ functions, and the MCP interface description. This fulfills the requirement for clear documentation at the top.

2.  **MCP (Message Channel Protocol) Interface:**
    *   **`Message` struct:**  Defines the structure of messages sent to the agent. It includes:
        *   `Type`:  A string indicating the function name to be executed.
        *   `Payload`: An `interface{}` to hold any type of data relevant to the function.
        *   `ResponseChan`:  A channel of type `chan Response`. This is crucial for asynchronous communication. The sender provides this channel in the message, and the agent sends the `Response` back through it.
    *   **`Response` struct:** Defines the structure of responses sent back from the agent. It includes:
        *   `Status`:  A string indicating "success" or "error".
        *   `Payload`: An `interface{}` to hold the result data (on success) or an error message (on error).
    *   **`AIAgent` struct:**  Represents the agent itself. It contains:
        *   `messageChan`:  A channel of type `chan Message`. This is the main channel through which the agent receives messages.
    *   **`Start()` method:**  Launches a goroutine (`agent.processMessages()`) that continuously listens for messages on `messageChan`. This makes the agent concurrent and able to handle messages asynchronously.
    *   **`SendMessage()` method:**  A function to send a message to the agent. It creates a `Message` struct, including a new `ResponseChan`, sends the message to `agent.messageChan`, and returns the `ResponseChan` to the caller. The caller can then wait on this channel to receive the agent's response.
    *   **`processMessages()` method:**  Runs in a goroutine. It's an infinite loop that:
        *   Receives a `Message` from `agent.messageChan`.
        *   Calls `agent.handleMessage()` to process the message based on its `Type`.
        *   Sends the `Response` back through the `msg.ResponseChan`.
        *   Closes the `msg.ResponseChan` to signal that the response is ready and no more data will be sent on it.
    *   **`handleMessage()` method:**  A central routing function that:
        *   Takes a `Message` as input.
        *   Uses a `switch` statement based on `msg.Type` to call the appropriate agent function (e.g., `AnticipateUserNeeds`, `CreativeContentGeneration`, etc.).
        *   Returns the `Response` from the called function.
        *   Includes a `default` case to handle unknown message types and return an error response.

3.  **20+ Advanced AI Functions:**
    *   The code defines 24 placeholder functions (easily extendable if needed).
    *   Each function name is designed to be descriptive and reflect an advanced or trendy AI concept as listed in the function summary.
    *   **Placeholders:**  The function implementations are currently very simple placeholders. They just print a message indicating the function is being executed and simulate some processing time using `time.Sleep` and `rand.Intn`.  **In a real-world agent, you would replace these placeholders with actual AI/ML logic.**

4.  **Example Usage in `main()`:**
    *   The `main()` function demonstrates how to create an `AIAgent`, start it, and send messages using `SendMessage()`.
    *   `sendAndReceive()` is a helper function to simplify sending messages and receiving/printing responses.
    *   Examples are provided for several function calls, including sending an "UnknownFunction" message to show error handling.
    *   `json.MarshalIndent` is used to pretty-print the JSON response payload for better readability.
    *   `time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)` at the end keeps the `main` goroutine running for a short time to allow the agent to process messages before the program exits.

**To make this a real AI Agent, you would need to:**

1.  **Replace Placeholder Implementations:**  Implement the actual AI logic within each function. This would involve:
    *   Integrating with relevant Go AI/ML libraries (e.g., for natural language processing, machine learning models, computer vision, etc.).
    *   Loading and using pre-trained models or training your own.
    *   Implementing algorithms for sentiment analysis, anomaly detection, content generation, etc. as described in the function summaries.
2.  **Data Management:**  Consider how the agent will store and access data (e.g., user profiles, historical data, knowledge bases, etc.). You might need to integrate with databases or other data storage solutions.
3.  **Error Handling and Robustness:**  Improve error handling beyond the basic "error" status. Implement more specific error messages and potentially retry mechanisms or logging.
4.  **Scalability and Performance:**  For a real application, you would need to consider scalability and performance.  The current MCP implementation using channels is a good starting point, but for very high loads, you might explore more advanced message queue systems or distributed architectures.
5.  **Security:**  If the agent interacts with external data or users, consider security implications and implement appropriate security measures.

This code provides a solid foundation for building a Go-based AI agent with a clear MCP interface and a set of interesting and advanced AI functions. You can expand upon this framework by implementing the actual AI functionalities to create a powerful and versatile agent.
