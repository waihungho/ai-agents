This AI Agent in Golang leverages an MCP (Modem Control Program) style interface to provide a unique and advanced set of functionalities. Instead of directly implementing complex AI algorithms (which would duplicate existing open-source libraries), this solution focuses on *agentic behaviors*, *meta-cognition*, *adaptive decision-making*, and *proactive interaction* through conceptually defined functions. The intelligence is simulated via internal state management and descriptive responses, emphasizing the *interface* and *architectural design* of an advanced AI agent.

```go
// AI-Agent with MCP Interface in Golang
//
// Outline:
// I. Introduction & Core Concepts
//    - Purpose: An advanced AI Agent designed to exhibit proactive, meta-cognitive,
//               and adaptive behaviors, focusing on agentic intelligence rather than
//               just task execution. It operates within a conceptual internal world model.
//    - Interface: Modem Control Program (MCP) style using textual AT commands.
//                 Commands are prefixed with "AT+", followed by a function name and arguments.
//                 Responses are "OK:<data>" for success or "ERROR:<message>" for failure.
//                 This simulates a low-bandwidth, structured command-response channel, reminiscent
//                 of how a system might interface with a highly specialized, embedded AI module.
//    - Go Architecture:
//        - `main.go`: The main entry point. Sets up the MCP interface (simulated over
//                     stdin/stdout for simplicity), initializes the AI Agent, and dispatches
//                     commands received from the interface.
//        - `mcp/mcp.go`: Implements the MCP protocol handler. This package is responsible for
//                        parsing incoming AT commands, validating their format, extracting arguments,
//                        and formatting outgoing responses according to the MCP standard. It acts
//                        as the communication gateway for the AI Agent.
//        - `agent/agent.go`: Defines the core `AIAgent` structure. This struct holds the
//                            agent's internal state, including goals, knowledge base, hypotheses,
//                            and a simulated environment model. It acts as the central dispatcher
//                            that maps MCP commands to the specific AI functionalities.
//        - `agent/functions.go`: Contains the concrete (conceptual) implementations for each
//                                 of the AI agent's functions, corresponding to the various AT commands.
//                                 These functions demonstrate advanced AI concepts through their
//                                 intended behavior and simulated outputs, avoiding direct duplication
//                                 of existing open-source machine learning libraries.
//        - `agent/environment.go`: A simple module representing the agent's internal,
//                                  constantly evolving world model. It's the agent's subjective
//                                  understanding and representation of its external context,
//                                  simulating dynamic changes based on perceived data.
//
// II. Agent Functions Summary (22 functions)
//
// A. Self-Management & Meta-Cognition: Functions enabling the agent to introspect, learn about itself, and optimize its own internal processes.
// 1. AT+SELF.REFLECT: Triggers a deep self-analysis of recent actions, decisions, and outcomes. Aims to identify biases, inefficiencies, or emergent patterns in its own behavior.
// 2. AT+SELF.OPTIMIZE: Initiates a process to refine its internal models (e.g., decision-making weights, predictive parameters) based on accumulated experience and reflection. This is an autonomous, iterative learning process.
// 3. AT+SELF.DIAGNOSE: Runs internal consistency checks on its knowledge base, goal coherence, and operational integrity. Reports potential contradictions or anomalies within its own internal state.
// 4. AT+STATE.SAVE <profile_name>: Persists the agent's current complete internal state (knowledge, goals, world model snapshot, learned parameters) to a named profile, enabling checkpointing or persona switching.
// 5. AT+STATE.LOAD <profile_name>: Loads a previously saved internal state, allowing the agent to resume operations from a specific point, revert to a known good state, or adopt a different learned persona.
//
// B. Goal Management & Planning: Functions for defining, tracking, analyzing, and dynamically adapting to strategic objectives.
// 6. AT+GOAL.SET <goal_id> <description>: Defines a new high-level strategic goal for the agent, which then triggers internal planning and resource allocation processes.
// 7. AT+GOAL.STATUS <goal_id>: Provides a detailed update on the progress, breakdown into sub-tasks, resource utilization, and current status of a specified strategic goal.
// 8. AT+GOAL.ANALYZE <goal_id>: Performs a comprehensive analysis of a goal's feasibility, resource requirements, potential conflicts with other active goals, and ethical implications before committing.
// 9. AT+PLAN.STRATEGIC <objective>: Generates a high-level, long-term strategic plan to achieve a complex objective, considering multiple pathways, dependencies, and contingencies.
// 10. AT+PLAN.ADAPTIVE <event_description>: Dynamically adjusts the current operational plan in real-time response to a specified unexpected event or significant environmental change, ensuring resilience.
//
// C. Cognitive & Learning Mechanisms: Functions for acquiring, processing, generating, and synthesizing knowledge from diverse sources.
// 11. AT+ENV.MODEL <data_stream_identifier>: Ingests and integrates new raw sensory or data streams into its probabilistic internal world model, continually refining its understanding of the environment.
// 12. AT+PREDICT <scenario_description>: Utilizes its refined internal world model and accumulated knowledge to generate probabilistic predictions about future events or outcomes given a hypothetical scenario.
// 13. AT+HYPO.GENERATE <topic>: Formulates novel, testable hypotheses or theories regarding an observed phenomenon or specified topic, going beyond simple data correlation to infer deeper relationships.
// 14. AT+HYPO.TEST <hypothesis_id> <simulation_params>: Designs and executes a high-fidelity simulation within its internal environment model to rigorously test a previously generated hypothesis, providing empirical (simulated) results.
// 15. AT+CONCEPT.ABSTRACT <raw_data_identifier>: Processes raw, unstructured data (e.g., text, sensor logs) to extract and formalize abstract concepts, principles, or latent patterns not explicitly stated.
// 16. AT+CONCEPT.SYNTHESIZE <concept_list>: Combines existing, disparate concepts (e.g., "entropy," "network," "resilience") to form novel, more complex conceptual constructs, fostering deeper understanding and insight.
// 17. AT+LEARN.TRANSFER <knowledge_block_id>: Incorporates a pre-digested, structured knowledge block (e.g., an expert system rule set, a pre-trained feature extractor) allowing for rapid assimilation of domain-specific information without raw learning.
//
// D. Interaction & Proactive Behavior (Simulated): Functions demonstrating the agent's ability to interact with a conceptual environment, evaluate actions, and exhibit autonomous awareness.
// 18. AT+ACT.SIMULATE <action_sequence_descriptor>: Executes a proposed sequence of actions within its internal world model to foresee potential consequences, risks, and benefits before real-world deployment.
// 19. AT+ACT.EVALUATE <simulation_result_id>: Analyzes the detailed outcome of a previously simulated action sequence, identifying optimal paths, potential risks, and unintended side effects, leading to refined decision-making.
// 20. AT+COMMS.SYNCHRONIZE <agent_id>: Attempts to align or merge aspects of its internal world model, knowledge base, or goal state with a conceptual 'peer' agent, simulating distributed cognition or collaborative learning.
// 21. AT+ETHIC.QUERY <action_plan_id>: Evaluates a proposed action plan against its defined internal ethical guidelines and principles, providing a judgment on its moral permissibility and suggesting potential mitigations.
// 22. AT+PERCEIVE.ANOMALY: Proactively scans its internal world model and incoming data streams for deviations from expected patterns, inconsistencies, or emergent threats, reporting significant anomalies without explicit prompting.
